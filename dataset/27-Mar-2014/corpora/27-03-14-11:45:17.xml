Owning or working for Harley-Davidson is a passion that transcends all stereotypical notions of age and gender. The passion for motorcycles and riding is paramount and takes precedence over everything.   I head marketing and communications for Harley-Davidson India. At Harley-Davidson, we fulfil dreams of personal freedom and that's the one guiding principle for everything we do. From this, comes developing strategies that are completely customer-led and experiential. And this transcends all touch points where a customer interacts with us - be it our world class dealerships which are more of destinations than a point of sale, our events and motorcycle rallies and even our creative approach to marketing collateral like our ads and what we do on digital and social media. Our relationship with a customer does not end with the sale of the motorcycle it actually begins there. This is what we do every day - it's all about the customer!   The field of marketing is exhilarating and extremely challenging. It is especially true in today's day and age when you are as good as your last campaign. Every brand is vying for a little piece of customer's attention that is ever changing and evolving.   Marketing allows you to push the envelope a little bit more with every new initiative, every campaign, and every event that you implement and gives you the customer interface unlike any other field. Also, any marketing mandate requires immense amount of multi-tasking which I think women are naturally gifted with.   My journey till date has been one hell of a ride (as we say at Harley). I have been associated with the world's most iconic brand and had the opportunity to be a part of the success story of Harley-Davidson India. Where else do you get to ride a thumping Harley-Davidson with hundreds of other passionate H.O.G. (Harley Owners Group) members as part of your work? I get to live my passion for motorcycles and riding every day, I truly couldn't have asked for more.   &#183; Know your brand inside-out: You can't possibly do anything or come up with any campaigns unless you know what you are working towards &#183; Know your audience: For any meaningful conversations to transpire, you need to know your customers or target audience really well &#183; Step out: No great ideas will suddenly transcend upon you in the four walls of your office. Don't be held up in your office at all times. Step out and talk to real people who are eventually going to make the difference. At Harley-Davidson, we organise various national and zonal rides for our customers. The feedback that we receive there is much more than any data or research study can ever provide &#183; Keep up with new developments: In such transcendent times, it is important to keep yourself updated and deconstruct your thought process every now and then to come up with something new and original every time! &#183; Do what you love: Lastly, it is important to stay true to your own beliefs. It is very stifling to be associated with something you don't believe in   I think the professional grounds have finally started to level for    in India. There are opportunities like never before and you are judged for your credentials and what you bring to the table. I think a quote from Steve Martin says it all and much more - "Be so good that they can't ignore you..." Keep your heads down and give your best...there is no shortcuts to success and nothing feels better than a hard day at work. </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>momentum indian
