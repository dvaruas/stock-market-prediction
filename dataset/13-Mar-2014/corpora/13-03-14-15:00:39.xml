in the air for four hours after its last confirmed contact, and may have been diverted to an unknown location, a leading American newspaper reported on Thursday.  It said US aviation investigators and national security officials are basing their theory on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from the Boeing 777's    engines, which suggested the plane flew for a total of five hours.  The paper attributed the information to two unidentified sources "familiar with the details". Contacted by a news agency, Rolls-Royce in Singapore said it could not comment on an ongoing investigation.  "We continue to monitor the situation and offer our support to Malaysia Airlines," the British engine maker said in a statement from Singapore.  The report could    that the    flight, which had 239 people on board, travelled for hundreds of miles after its last contact with air traffic control at around 1:30 am Saturday (1730 GMT Friday) &#8212; about an hour after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing.  Search teams are already covering a huge area comprising 27,000 nautical miles (more than 90,000 square kilometres), from the South China Sea to the waters west of Malaysia.  Malaysian investigators have made clear that they are still considering hijacking as one of their lines of inquiry and the    has not ruled out a terror link.  "US counterterrorism officials are pursuing the possibility that a pilot or someone else on board the plane may have diverted it toward an undisclosed location after intentionally turning off the jetliner's transponders to avoid radar detection," the paper reported, citing "one person tracking the probe".  It went on to say that the uncertainty over the plane's course and why its transponders were not working "has raised theories among investigators that the aircraft may have been commandeered for a reason that appears unclear to US authorities".  Officials had been told that investigators were pursuing the theory that the plane was diverted "with the intention of using it later for another purpose", the paper quoted one source as saying.  New Scientist magazine also reported that Rolls-Royce had received "at least two bursts of technical data" from flight    at its British monitoring centre in Derby, which keeps a real-time track of its engines in use on civilian aircraft around the world.  One of the data sets was sent on takeoff, the other during the climb towards Beijing, the magazine said on its website on Wednesday.  It said the engine data was "filtered" from a larger report from the plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) system &#8212; which puts out information about location and airspeed.  Malaysia Airlines has said that all its aircraft are equipped with   , but has said that "no information was relayed" by the system installed on flight MH370 and that there was no distress signal from the cockpit.  Frustration over the shifting focus of the search and apparent lack of concrete information on the plane's flight path has led to accusations of a chaotic and confused response by the Malaysian authorities and the airline.</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>pari french jet maker said thursday expect lower revenu year sale busi jet slow sharpli pick last year. compani also make fighter jet said expect deliv around falcon jet year compar last year . adjust net incom fell percent million euro . million compani said would propos dividend . euro per share compar . euro share . dassault aviat post februari per cent rise full-year revenu . billion euro help rise falcon deliveries. . euro</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>definitely. howev certain lag effect therefor see export continu de-grow would expect iip sustain posit territori go ahead. expect iip growth remain fairli mute account extern well domest factors. definitely. number probabl near-term bottom. would expect upsid headlin inflat number go ahead. look trajectori next three four month expect upside. cours recent untim rain hailstorm seen consider amount damag crops. also led postpon harvest begin rabi season like impact. unfavour base effect time expect much downsid data. overal next three four read would surpris us positively. ye reason believ would maintain caution henc statu quo polici rates. think go rate hike moment. would like see underli current far inflat concern probabl take call. moment expect chang polici stanc would definit maintain caution. near term rang hold time. cours extern shock could possibl break rang given ukraine-rel crisis. crisi boil hard land chines data front -- consid late see fairli weak data china -- could bring ugli side sentiments. howev sentiment global remain less stabl would expect rang hold near term. lot post elect expect stabl govern alreadi price lot money wait come alreadi done so. howev post elect even see stabl govern realli expect sharp gain rupee. henc - rang fairli like exist even elect next three four month brief breach . would like believ rbi may come boost fx reserv purchas dollar pressur downsid .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>toronto breakthrough scientist found first terrestri sampl water-rich gem suggest larg volum water exist deep beneath earth. intern team scientist led chair arctic resourc univers alberta discov first-ev sampl miner call ringwoodite. analysi miner show contain signific amount water - . per cent weight - find confirm scientif theori vast volum water trap kilometr beneath earth upper lower mantle. sampl realli provid extrem strong confirm local wet spot deep area said pearson professor faculti science. particular zone earth transit zone might much water world ocean put togeth pearson said. ringwoodit form miner peridot believ exist larg quantiti high pressur transit zone. ringwoodit found meteorit terrestri sampl ever unearth scientist abl conduct fieldwork extrem depths. pearson sampl found juina area mato grosso brazil artisan miner unearth host diamond shallow river gravels. diamond brought earth surfac volcan rock known kimberlit - deepli deriv volcan rocks. pearson said discoveri almost accident team look anoth miner found three-millimetre-wid dirty-look commerci worthless brown diamond. ringwoodit invis nake eye buri beneath surfac fortun found pearson graduat student john mcneill . sampl underw year analysi use raman infrar spectroscopi x-ray diffract offici confirm ringwoodite. studi publish journal natur .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>price oil rose per barrel thursday plung day concern china econom slowdown deepening. us april deliveri cent . per barrel gmt electron trade new york mercantil exchange. day earlier contract fell . close . first close month. brent crude use set price intern varieti crude cent . ice exchang london. declin chines export februari fuel worri world second-largest economi weaken further. growth factori output invest retail sale report thursday unusu weak. fall spike last week fear russia militari incurs crimean peninsula might us european sanction one world largest energi suppliers. provid support price organ petroleum export countri account around third world oil product rais slightli forecast global crude demand . monthli oil market report releas wednesday estim world consum . million barrel day year . million barrel barrel group previou forecast releas februari .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
