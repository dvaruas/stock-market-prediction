Both are decades senior to the party's PM candidate    and the leadership is not sure whether they will like to work in his Cabinet. Though Advani is likely to continue as chairman of NDA, the position, with Modi occupying the PMO essentially on the strength of his mass appeal, will pale before the power the veteran had wielded as the number two in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime.   Joshi, along with Vajpayee and Advani, was part of the troika which guided the party in the early 1990s. In fact, Modi had accompanied Joshi when the latter undertook his 47-day Bharat Ekta Yatra to hoist the Tricolour at Lal Chowk in Srinagar in defiance of prohibitory orders.   The equations between them and Modi have since drastically changed, with the PM candidate emerging as the new    talisman who, going by exit poll forecasts, may lead BJP to power at the Centre after a decade-long power drought. Advani and Joshi had opposed Modi being designated the PM candidate, but were overruled.   With no position commensurate to their standing available outside the government, the party leadership is struggling to get its arm around the issue.     Sources indicated that the issue figured in separate conversations Nitin Gadkari had with the veteran duo on Tuesday. They said that Gadkari, who had a meeting with Modi in Ahmedabad on Monday, had tried to ascertain whether Advani and Joshi had anything specific in their minds on their role in the likely new dispensation.   Gadkari, Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley will visit Modi in Gandhinagar on Wednesday as part of the informal ministry-making exercise the party has started in the belief that it will take over the Centre's reins after May 16.   While the issue of finding suitable slots for Advani and Joshi are supposed to be on the agenda of the Gandhinagar meeting, many in the party feel that the matter be left to the RSS leadership to handle.   Significantly, RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat, along with four of his senior-most colleagues &#8212; general secretary Suresh 'Bhaiyaji' Joshi and joint general secretaries Suresh Soni, Krishna Gopal and Dattatreya Hosbole &#8212; are going to be in Delhi from Thursday should BJP need them for consultations.   Significantly, Bhagwat and his senior colleagues have long believed that BJP    above 75 years should make way for others and concentrate on tasks of "nation building and social service". </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi presid may invit singl largest pre-pol combin form govern unless provid letter support parti prove requir numbers. extens consult ascertain best suit provid stabl govern hung hous scenario mukherje seem conclud contend power ought back claim major support produc letter support post-pol allies. want make sure stake claim form govern actual enjoy major support hous said sourc familiar detail deliber mukherje hold order ensur next regim turn stabl one. advis could done seek letter support post-pol allianc partner done earlier occasion. refus form govern despit emerg singl largest parti presid r venkataraman invit v p singh form govern leader janata dal manag cobbl togeth post-pol alliance. preced follow shankar dayal sharma invit atal bihari vajpayee-l bjp form govern even though member absolut chanc reach magic figur . bjp surpris invit though grab opportun form first-ev regim centre. secular parti combin vajpaye govern quit days. sharma successor kr narayanan chose play safe vajpaye stake second claim two year later insist see letter support even bjp-led nda pre-pol allianc won majority. use yardstick narayanan year later result huge embarrass congress presid . congress presid claim support sp chief back last minut came short presid ask letter support. contact toi note constitut expert former attorney gener soli j sorabje suggest produc letter support may necessari presid satisfi singl largest parti pre-pol coalit hold prospect provid viabl govern elect fail throw outright winner. presid satisfi count need seek letter support post-pol allianc partners. invit largest coalit parti form govern could given reason time say week two prove major floor hous sorabje said. presid need test strength parti coalit invit form government. test strength hous rashtrapati bhavan. though noth constitut bar presid seek letter support post-pol allianc partner sound littl uneth ad .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>aditya birla nuvo buy call target rs stop loss rs .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>tokyo asian share move higher wednesday s&amp;p hit record high japan benchmark fell investor lock profit recent gains. stock index lost . per cent . per cent jump day weaker yen. south korea kospi ad . per cent . hang seng hong kong perk midday break gain . per cent .. elsewher asia mainland china market fell weak econom data share rose thailand philippin malaysia indonesia. standard &amp; poor top mark first time tuesday driven optim econom recoveri close . per cent .. industri averag also rose . per cent . though technology-focus composit lost . per cent .. european share also rose lift us ralli sign germani bundesbank central bank may will back stimulu includ interest rate cut european central bank. market japanes yen trade . u.s. dollar compar close tuesday .. euro . versu tuesday close .. benchmark us crude june deliveri cent . barrel electron trade new york mercantil exchange. contract gain . tuesday . barrel highest close sinc april .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item></items>
