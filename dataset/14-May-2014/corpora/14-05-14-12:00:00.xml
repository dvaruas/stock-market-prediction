Union minister and Pawar confidant Praful Patel said the general view was that BJP would emerge as the single largest party and possibly form the government. "The question is how close they are to the halfway mark or if they want any ally, all this will become clear on May 16. But the government should be stable. A stable and good government is good for the country," he said.   The remark was seen by observers as an indication that the Maharashtra outfit could be ready to jump ship.    has been part of Congress-led UPA since 2004 while also being part of the Congress alliance in Maharashtra.   Patel asserted that people's mandate had to be respected, a remark that raised the question if it was averse to any Congress attempt to cobble together a Third Front-type of arrangement.   NCP again managed to raise dust about its post-poll intent. Doubts arose when Pawar called Narendra Modi a friend. Eyebrows were also raised when Pawar stepped in to protest against the renewed attempt to set up the    to probe 'snoopgate' against Modi during the elections. His veto is said to have scuppered the renewed Congress aggression on the stalking issue.   Importantly, PA Sangma, who had quit the NCP to form his own party, has already met Modi.   Patel sought to tamp down on   . "We are not looking at any particular position. We are a part of UPA. Let's not draw a particular conjecture. It's important that people's mandate is respected, whatever it may be. We had a mandate for 10 years," he said.   NCP feels that BJP-led alliance is close enough to the majority mark and may not need too large a number beyond its present alliance.   While Pawar joining hands with BJP is not altogether impossible, the Maharashtra angle complicates the issue. Sources said three major forces of the state in one camp &#8212; NCP, Shiv Sena and BJP &#8212; is difficult to manage, especially when the assembly elections are scheduled in less than six months. "We all vie for the same space and accommodating the workers's aspirations could be difficult," a senior leader said.   There are likely to be jitters in the Congress over NCP ahead of results. A defection by Pawar could deal a serious blow to the mother outfit because it would then be without an ally in the state. The party has fought the assembly polls alone just once in the wake of Pawar's rebellion in 1999 but it proved to be shortlived as NCP immediately joined hands with Congress to form the state government. They have been together since.   A senior leader said the NCP had not made up its mind on whether to quit the UPA. But much would depend on the results and the sweep of the BJP's victory, as predicted by the exit polls. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi benchmark indic quickli pare intraday gain turn choppi mid-morn trade wednesday weigh loss capit good oil &amp;
