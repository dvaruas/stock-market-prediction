<items><item><body>Tom Course  32  CEO, Canvas Laugh Factory     A guy from across the sea who is now living in India. I have been here for threeand-a-half years and love it. I'm a CEO in the entertainment industry so my life is bonkers.     Walter from Breaking Bad, but without the complex family life. I'm a bit of a chance taker.     Possibly Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings. Not because I am old and grey but because I see myself pushing pieces on a giant chessboard to achieve victory.     A quick wit and a willingness to go crazy. On a night out, you'd wear... Mainly, I wear clothes.     Cricket. That's what living in India for years does to you.     The one I live in, and currently that's Mumbai.     I bought a small greegreen car. It was my freedom.     The Italian Job &#8212; the Michael Caine original, not that god awful remake.     Me of course. I'm at least two inches taller than him and don't hire people to clap and cheer when I get off a plane.     Game of Thrones but set in the Mad Men era. Imagine that epic story in those suits.     Justin Bieber. Just the fact that in order to answer this question you will have to print his name somehow in connection with mine makes my skin crawl.     Mumbai, of course even though it's a bit difficult to find one with a real sense of herself. But when you do, it's combined with a quick wit and Indian beauty. Sounds perfect to me.     A cat. Cute but a little bit evil.     Bob Marley, Alan Sugar, Winston Churchill, Freddie Mercury and Aditi Mittal. Your life's motto is... Live hard, love hard, leave happy. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi amid report lobbi comeback chief today said would chang parti leadership. gadkari remov parti chief face alleg irregular busi group float said continu steer parti even govern format ahead lok sabha polls. no...thi type promis never given anybody. expect that. role whatev may decid parti gadkari recent got clean chit form incom tax depart said. make clear never ask anyth former bjp chief said strong convict polit instrument socio-econom reforms. purpos convict countri first parti second parti consid said. said parti presid senior leader decid whichev role right him. gadkari said leadership rajnath singh narendra modi parti work form govern question chang leadership. ask would offer post speaker said b vajpaye advani founder party. motiv inspir us. ultim appropri time discuss issu parti take decis said. ask allianc said get major parti door parti want join it. question minor majority. whoever want join us well take together. despit resist virodh...whoev support well take support. broad approach. parti father-son mother-son party. democrat parti sit discuss decide. decid leadership leaders. today confus aggress parti gadkari said .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>london rose -month high euro wednesday extend recent gain report could set stage uk monetari tighten come months. data also due wednesday gmt hour inflat report set figur could potenti provid strong signal time expect rise interest rates. analyst begin specul first hike could come late rather earli next year. euro . per cent lower pound . penc lowest sinc januari . sterl also firm dollar . bull eye near five-year high . struck last week. mani analyst expect boe start tighten cycl major global central banks. hold bullish view pound present expect market view boe first rais offici interest rate reinforc quarterli inflat report press confer governor mark carney said derek halpenni european head global research bank tokyo mitsubishi. sterl trade-weight index trade near year high .. euro also hurt media report tuesday readi back raft stimulu measur euro zone economi cut inflat forecast next week. bolster expect polici eas european central bank next month. reuter wednesday quot sourc say ecb prepar packag polici option june meet includ cut interest rate target measur aim boost lend small- mid-siz firms. differ outlook uk euro zone help push yield offer two-year british gilt euro zone bond widest sinc . help pound trader said .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
