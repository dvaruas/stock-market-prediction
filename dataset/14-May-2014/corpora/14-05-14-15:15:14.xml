Going ahead we still feel that most of the PSU banks will perform better. So PNB will surely be one of them.    This is what I have been advising now for the last 8 to 10 days, saying that at every rise it is time to book out to a certain extent. It is always prudent. I am talking about 30% to 35% of the portfolio. Especially if you bought in the last five or six months, you are actually sitting on profits ranging from 40% to possibly 100-150% in some cases. So when you are sitting on that sort of profit, it is always prudent to book out to a certain extent because the best of the news is already there in the price. Assuming that the    turn out to be true, you can possibly have one more bump &#8212; up 150-200 points may be &#8212; but that is not really worth playing for. Because in case the final result turns out differently and the exit polls are off the mark, the downside could be huge. So it is better to take that bird which is in your hand than hope for two in the bush, as the saying goes.    To a large extent I will book out the OMCs, because I had recommended HPCL way back in October-November at about 170-175 levels, and if one is making 100% plus in a stock like that, it is prudent to book out to a large extent. If you are talking of Reliance, the move has just begun. In fact, I was one of the very few people who were actually bullish on Reliance all through. We had a price target of about 1175-1200. So that should be achieved quite soon. In fact, I had that target in the next 8-10 months. But in the light of recent developments, that should now happen in the next eight weeks.     </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>mumbai trade rs lower rs per gram local grey market wednesday pressur partli gain rupee. offici market zaveri bazaar close buddha purnima festival. hit -month high dollar close . dollar tuesday. peopl start purchas coin invest avenu like hold smaller denomin price correct said. analyst expect yellow metal price fall week. dealer cite restrict gold import continu weigh demand supplies. curb impos discourag gold import play key role widen countri deficit pull rupe lower. restrict impact. india import around tonn januari april year compar tonn april alon last year said industri sourc .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>front line stock take breather three-four day good move short term pullback expected. first level look downsid would around - break might see profit book toward level good area buy market especi front line lead . overal trend remain posit see level beyond possibl next day come albeit kind choppi might happen still actual event go .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>mumbai ralli indian taken mani peopl surprise. surg point . per cent last three session expect clear major nda govern . cnn-ibn- csd exit poll predict - seat nda. india today-cicero poll expect - seat abp-neilson see nda bag seat time now-org see saffron allianc win seats. stabl business-friendli govern may usher polici reform faster econom growth medium term believ focu could return fundament like near-term volatil elect verdict digest said barclay equiti research report. accord analyst actual result may inlin exit poll good scope post-elect result rally. frontlin stock well midcap may see sharp rise stock central ralli psu economi relat sectors. market ralli per cent past days. near term market discount lot good news margin error appear low actual result beli market expectations. howev think market trade premium long term averag investor anticip spate reform lead turn econom cycl said report. brokerag sensex target year-end. stabl govern scenario highlight three theme high qualiti domest cyclic b reform exposur c exposur beaten deep cyclic tactic strategi includ infrastructur psu bank report added. prefer maruti icici bank sbi ongc jaiprakash associ ultratech among largecaps. midcap smallcap space brokerag like eicher motor motherson sumi ye bank aurobindo pharma. indic nda form govern without troubl say clsa. accord brokerag note exit poll even lower end poll meet market expectations. give flexibl narendra modi pursu growth policies. potenti strong govern posit invest play viz. icici bank axi bank sbi l&amp;t ultratech maruti. next govern howev difficult task manag inflat fiscal deficit weak monsoon might keep market consolid phase short term immedi elect result report said. accord motil oswal market may touch - exit poll figur right. brokerag expect floor next - years. current market level could start big bull ralli says. brokerag bullish capit good infra bank sector long term. see hdfc bank axi bank icici bank qualiti buy calls. ambit capit - sensex target year-end. expect market go - per cent next one month. prefer bank baroda sbi pnb privat sector bank advis book profit kotak bank hdfc bank. accord brokerag auto sector export perspect major potential. see - per cent upsid tv motor long term. among infrastructur pack see upsid sadbhav engin ashoka buildon. quant capit expect india equiti recov q nda get - seat prompt nifti touch . year-end target potenti upsid - per cent midcap space. continu remain overweight privat bank oil &amp; ga agrochem select infrastructur pharma &amp; stocks. sinc pharma sector outperform way long henc underperform short period medium-term outlook still posit maintain bull run thesi pharma fmcg report said. brokerag bullish icici bank axi bank pnb boi ye bank ril ioc ongc gail hpcl maruti suzuki m&amp;m motherson sumi apollo tyres. also expect unit phosphoru dhanuka agritech lupin divi aurobindo pharma l&amp;t volta crompton greav cummin tc mind tree tech mahindra hcl tech tata steel centuri textil db corp emami ltd irb infra havel india welspun india outperform new govern take charg .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
