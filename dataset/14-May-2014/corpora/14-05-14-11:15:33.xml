<items><item><body> Whether through money, talent, or just good publicity, certain families dominate American life. There are legendary old money dynasties, twentieth century industrial dynasties, entertainment and sports dynasties, and political dynasties that hold a surprising amount of power for a democratic country.       The first Kennedys emigrated from Ireland to Boston in 1848, and after just one generation, a Kennedy entered politics, when Patrick Joseph PJ served first as state representative. PJ's son, Joseph Patrick, became the US ambassador to the UK and had nine children. The three youngest of PJ's sons, John F, Robert F, and Ted, all became prominent figures. JFK and Jackie O's daughter Caroline is the US Ambassador to Japan; JFK's sister Eunice married former mayor of Santa Monica, Calif., Robert Sargent Shriver, Jr., and their daughter Maria married actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.     Ralph Lauren was born Ralph Lifschitz to a Jewish immigrant family in New York. He had an early interest in dressing well and looking his best, paying for his education with evening jobs. While working one of these jobs, Ralph began designing wide ties &#8212; a contrast to the skinny ties that were "in" at the time &#8212; and his Polo label was born. David is the only of Ralph's children who entered his father's business. He is now executive vice president of   , marketing, and corporate communications at Ralph Lauren, and is married to George W Bush's niece, Lauren Bush.     Larry Ellison is one of the wealthiest and most powerful people in tech. Larry was born to an unwed Jewish mother whose family, according to Fortune, took the name 'Ellison' after Ellis Island. Larry's mother gave him to relatives for adoption at a young age, and he's only met her once. The college drop-out, now 69, built his enormous enterprise empire from the ground up and is now worth an estimated $49.3 billion. He's also a real-estate mogul, with a portfolio the size of the phone book that includes the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai. His latest initiative is to wipe out polio, as he recently pledged $100 million to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.     Francis Ford's parents were musicians, but he went into Hollywood, and directed blockbusters like the Godfather movies, The Great Gatsby (1974), and Apocalypse Now, which earned him three Oscars and two Golden Globes. His siblings, Talia Coppola Shire, and August Floyd Coppola, are also in film and gave birth to the next generation of film greats: Talia is the mother of actor Jason Schwartzman, and August is the father of actor Nicholas Cage. Francis Ford's family went into the film industry too: his wife is a documentarian, son Roman is a producer and screenwriter, and daughter Sofia, who made her acting debut as the baby in the first Godfather movie, is best known for her films Somewhere and Lost in Translation.     Estee Lauder built a client-focused cosmetics empire from the ground up that hooked millions of loyal followers around the world. Estee Lauder and her descendants are worth billions. Born to immigrant parents in NY, Estee Lauder made her own cosmetics and sold them at local beauty salons. With financial help from her father, she opened Estee Lauder Cosmetics in Manhattan in the mid-1940s. Her husband and her sons helped her run the business. Their charitable organisation Lauder Foundation gives to Jewish heritage charities around the world.     Former president Bill Clinton was born William Blythe III; "Clinton" came from his stepfather's last name. Bill wanted to be a musician before a chance meeting with JFK inspired him to go into politics. His wife Hillary Rodham Clinton was both a lawyer and a teacher before taking the title of First Lady. A major advocate for national health care reform and other public health issues, she was elected Senator of New York in 2000, and most recently served as US Secretary of State. Her experience makes her a popular choice for the presidency in 2016. The Clintons' daughter Chelsea follows lightly in her parents' footsteps as a special correspondent for NBC. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>pune union govern reduc incent raw export almost third rs per tonn rs per tonn april may. call betray sugar industri said decis result loss mill export sugar april may. industri surpris highli disappoint reduct rate incent said abinash verma director gener indian sugar mill associ isma. issu notif regard may . letter written food secretari said accord notif sugar mill export also import countri enter contract export import sugar physic export substanti quantiti expect rs per tonn incent raw sugar exports. chang posit govern without notic ground whatsoev contravent provis gazett notif law prescrib regard creat massiv confus market sens betray amongst miller country. base ruppe-dollar exchang rate criteria subsidi april may work rs per tonne. howev industri expect remain constant rs sper tonn one go cabinet increas subsidy. reduct result loss mill dispatch export sugar april . accord industri sourc quantiti could lakh tonn lakh tonne. downward revis export incent almost one third also like put pressur domest price seen declin trend past weeks. big dispar world market indian market announc raw sugar subsidy. reduct subsidi widen dispar reduc put price domest market pressur said rahil shaikh manag director london head-quart trade compani ed&amp;f man. ministri food announc incent rs per tonn februari march . calcul everi two month take account averag exchang rate rupe vis-a-vi dollar seven day immedi april june august april-may june-juli august-septemb respect . claim accord law prescrib ministri februari isma said reduct rate incent appreci surplu sugar countri need export . ex-mil sugar price fallen past one month continu lower cost product lead loss industri cane price arrear farmer continu outstand histor highest level rs crore said letter .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>melbourn today said take step ban boko haram milit group respons kidnap nearli schoolgirl nigeria. govern take step commenc process ban terrorist organis australian prime minist quot say aap news agency. whole world transfix horrifi group hostage-tak schoolgirl said. take step australia would act consist intern partner us uk canada nigeria said. opposit labour parti leader bill shorten also support move said parti also extrem concern kidnap .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
