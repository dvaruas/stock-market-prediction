They draw attention to controversial issues of our time &#8212; use of force by great powers, legitimacy of regime change carried out through external intervention, question of self-determination for minorities and utility of economic sanctions.   The Crimean referendum to break away from Ukraine was conducted under supervision of the Russian military and its allied 'self-defence units', evoking howls of outrage from the United States and the   . German Chancellor    condemned resort to military means to enforce Moscow's will as "outdated geopolitics" and old-fashioned tactics that have no    in the era of mutual cooperation and globalisation.   Redrawing of borders of a sovereign state through military assistance from an outside power does go against the status quo of international order. Yet, in Crimea, Russian President    did not make the first move to illegally dismember Ukraine. Rather, he reacted after an illegal overthrow of a friendly regime in    by mobs receiving moral, diplomatic and financial support from the West.   From Putin's perspective, the Europeans and Americans who are fulminating against    for egging Crimea's secession from Ukraine were the ones who created the problem initially by funding the downfall of a democratically elected pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. If intervention by western powers to topple an elected president is legal, Putin would contend, how could Russia's attempt to defensively protect Russian-speaking minorities in Ukraine by giving them the right to self-determination be illegal?   Two wrongs may not make a right, but Putin is responding in a hardnosed tit-for-tat strategy to western moves to weaken Russia's influence over post-Soviet space. His message to the West is simple: do not mess with Russian interests using foul means, else i can pay you back in the same coin.   The Crimean episode illustrates the West cannot claim to be on a moral high ground and that it must also introspect how it misplayed its hand in the Ukrainian crisis. At a broader level, irrespective of Merkel's notion that use of force is obsolete in international relations, the West has repeatedly used military might to effect regime changes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, often bypassing international law. Putin's world view is deeply configured by how the West talks about law but relies on military force when it suits western interests.   In 2008, Putin enabled two small enclaves of Georgia &#8212; Abkhazia and South Ossetia &#8212; to secede and declare themselves as independent states as a payback for the pro-western Georgian regime's attempts to enter the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) and use western aid to undermine Russian security. Crimea today is almost a carbon copy of the Abkhazian and South Ossetian experiences, with no lessons learnt by the West about the costs of provoking the Russian bear in regions where a "post-Soviet sentiment" of nostalgia for 'mother Russia' lingers. </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item></items>
