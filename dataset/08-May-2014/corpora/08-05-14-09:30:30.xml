He was a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow in the programme's inaugural year. He joined Menlo Ventures in 2013 as a partner to focus on finding and funding interesting and world-changing companies.   Right now, he's also working on Code for India, a programme he founded to inspire engineers in the US and abroad to use technology to help India's poor. Code for India will be holding its second hack-a-thon -happening simultaneously in Mountain View and Bengaluru on May 9. This year's event will revolve around the theme of using tech to make India more resilient to natural disasters. Mehta speaks about his plans for India:     India already has a large number of tech developers and there's also a large Indian developer community in the US. The country has massive challenges in the public service infrastructure and the government that need a lot of help. So there is an opportunity for tech developers to volunteer. We have a very diverse group pitching in and building software. And instead of starting another NGO to try to focus on various issues, Code for India cuts across horizontally and provides a technology backbone to existing non governmental organisations. It's been a wonderful,    source movement, and we've created some great apps &#8212; over 20 of them so far.     One of our apps that gets the most attention is the voting app, I Vote For A Better India. India is going through a massive election with 1.2 billion people going out to vote. Our community of developers and entrepreneurs have developed this app to increase voter registration. With the mobile devices, and the software we built, we cut down the hassle of registration. That made a big impact over the past few months. Our volunteers were able to convince even the election commissioner to use the app, which was a big achievement and it's kind of super-charging all the other projects.     Silicon Valley gets a fair share of blame for not doing much in the social impact space and I think that is quite legitimate. We have more companies getting funded that are just solving the first world problems than the second or third world problems. We're still far from changing the mindset of people to build, take risks, and try to innovate in areas that will make an impact.   </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>washington three indian-american along other sworn member presidenti charg work improv qualiti life asian american pacif island aapis. presid advisori commiss aapi advis presid obama innov way engag aapi across countri improv health educ environ well-being. democrat parti activist fundrais lt col actor new commission sworn sri srinivasan chandigarh born us circuit court judg washington monday. narasimhan co-found emerg institut formerli known indian institut sustain enterpris bangalor nonprofit institut train entrepreneur build social ventures. pancholi film televis stage actor voic sanjay titl charact nickelodeon anim seri sanjay &amp; craig well voic baljeet disney anim seri phinea ferb. chaudhari air forc offic current serv execut offic command air forc district washington joint base andrew maryland. commission accord serv eye ear aapi commun sworn event attend us vice presid mark aapi heritag month. recollect trip india last year biden acknowledg contribut aapi commun sphere us life. combin asian-american pacif island done noth noth succeed gener gener said. think busi built corner store silicon valley giant like yahoo. serv nation oversea biden said. commiss indian american execut director kiran ahuja said aapi fast rise. import recognis commun great divers import govern commun work togeth address uniqu challeng face added. year theme aapi heritag month beyond. phrase captur aspir american spirit american asian pacif island descent alway sought excel beyond challeng limit equal opportun america. event continu throughout may highlight commun mani contribut art scienc govern militari commerc educ .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>sell call target rs stop loss rs .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>hong kong asian climb earli thursday buoy fed chief comment track solid growth second quarter russian concess crisis. tokyo stock . per cent break revers tumbl previou day feder reserv chair janet yellen told congress econom outlook posit us stimulu taper would continu steadily. rebound yesterday sharp fall - market get support brisk session wall street said tokai tokyo secur strategist seiichi . dow jone industri averag rose . per cent . wednesday nasdaq composit index fell . per cent .. hong kong advanc . per cent earli trade thursday shanghai edg . per cent sydney . per cent seoul inch . percent. chines stock trade cautious ahead releas april trade data show export import rise margin rebound sharp declin month countri report second straight trade surplus. dollar . yen earli thursday compar . yen new york wednesday afternoon yellen testimony. euro fetch . . yen . . yen us trade. us stock finish mostli higher follow conciliatori statement russian presid vladimir putin told pro-russian rebel fight east ukrain halt plan independ referendums. putin also said troop pull back border nato washington said evid withdrawal. surpris comment suggest potenti de-escal conflict build toward war sent russia soar batter rubl jump five-week high dollar. gregori volokhin presid meeschaert capit said yellen comment encourag us investor putin remark also posit effect index even investor sceptic russian president. howev yahoo tumbl wednesday concern stake alibaba may worth less anticip follow chines onlin giant stock market offering. oil price mix thursday. us west texa intermedi june deliveri four cent . earli asian trade brent north sea crude june eas cent . per barrel. fetch . gmt compar . late wednesday .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>ltd sell call target rs stop loss rs .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
