Air bags and leather seats are passe. The young consumers, many of whom are budding entrepreneurs, look for bold colours and cuttingedge tech support to make a style statement with their luxury cars. And SUV is the new sexy in this segment.   While white, black and silver are the alltime favourites for certain segments in the luxury range, the younger lot is more inclined to brighter shades. "Vibrant colours are more popular in our sports range. The red colour is quite popular in our performance range followed by blue in certain models," says Joe King, head, Audi India. German luxury carmaker Mercedes Benz i s also seeing the change in colour preferences.   Eberhard Kern, managing director and CEO of Mercedes Benz India, says that while the traditional Mercedes Benz customer prefers white and silver for the chauffer-driven S class, red remains the clear favourite among the younger generation buyers of the A class. "This customer is tech-savvy. It's not just only about the car but also the technology inside it," says Kern.   Bluetooth connectivity, up-market surround sound system, voice dialogue system, rear view camera, navigation system and music streaming are some of the favourites that top the tech wish list of young buyers. "Today's customer is more gadget-driven," says Rohit Suri, vice-president, Jaguar Land Rover India. And luxury car manufacturers are trying to keep pace with the younger consumers' predilection for technology. So even Rolls Royce, an over a century-old keeper of tradition, has taken note.   "The principle in Rolls-Royce is that designs are timeless, so we don't change for change's sake. [But] that doesn't mean that we don't move with the times," says Hal Serudin, Asia Pacific-South corporate communications manager, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. The Phantom Series II is a good example of how the elegant car maker has gone tech with aplomb &#8212; the car sports new eightspeed transmission, updated camera and navigation systems and an advanced, full LED headlight system. Infotainment features are also on the musthave list of young consumers, says Audi India's King.   For the i-phone generation, looks matter the most and "people don't like traditional proxy looks anymore. In fact, functional requirements often take the backseat when it comes to choosing a car," says JLR's Suri. SUV is the current hot favourite and every other company is vying to launch variants in this space to cater to the rising demand, he says.   Mercedes Benz's Kern sees more coming: "Design is gaining more importance these days and after the growing popularity of SUVs, the next favourite is the sporty look in a luxury car," says Kern. One of BMW's recent launches, the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo, adorns a sporty look to cater to the younger base.   Says Phillip von Sahr, president, BMW Group India: "It needed to be sporty, agile and precise with more space and greater everyday functionality, packaged in a sporty design that showcases its 3 series genes." Even at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars where the bulk of sales comprise the four-door saloons - Ghost and Phantom -- the company is seeing a strong order bank with the two door Wraith fastback, which appeals to a broader, younger audience, says Serudin </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body> With the blazing speed of the internet mitigating our every expectation-especially wait times-it's no wonder we get impatient so easily. Delays at the airport are particularly maddening, because there never seem to be enough seats to accommodate the many fuming passengers who all need to get their destinations more urgently than you. RESMO, a dynamic and malleable piece of folding furniture, is designed to solve just this problem.   The hybrid chair's design makes it incredibly functional, since it can be molded into a chair, a bed, or even a love seat for those traveling with company. The chair also boasts an extra flap that can be craned over into a hanging screen to give users privacy. The pros are obvious. But what about the cons? RESMO is being proposed as a service that airlines will offer passengers who have been inconvenienced &#8212; not as a free-forall seating epidemic that airports will have to deal with regularly.   However, its implementation inevitably raises the question: how will airports regulate and restrict the use of chairs and beds that turn any public space into a seemingly private domain? The TSA gets angry when I forget the wine key in my backpack-how will they respond to potential fire code violations that people splayed on the ground in every which way will surely bring? While RESMO is in its infancy, its usage may thrive outside airports if taken to the street.   Lawn seating at music festivals is always burdensome, because you either pack so much gear that you might as well bring a tent, or your blanket gets rather uncomfortable quickly. RESMO could serve as a nice alternative to pop-up public seating.   </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
