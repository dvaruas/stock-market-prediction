But who's the better of the two?     Middleton tries cricket in New Zealand. Let's see the Sachin Tendulkars of the world do this in a red skirt and high heels, eh?     The American volleys at the net like a pro during a charity event in 2011. All she needs is a grunt to match that struggle face.     Middleton's table tennis prowess on display in 2012. She can coach kids on playing sports without getting a hair out of   .     Middleton returns to her old stomping ground &#8212; her prep school. Sprinting like a gazelle in her fancy trench coat and heels, she looks every bit the natural.     Obama chose this ping pong moment to throw some shade at her husband. "He thinks he's better than he really is." Ouch!     Obama bends it like Beckham in presence of the footballer himself. Team USA needs some Michelle magic at FIFA this year.     This is how you unveil a post-pregnancy body. Put on a pair of wedges and slam that volleyball. </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi appreci substanti past month indian currenc seem lost momentum. weaken key per mark hit one-month low track loss region currencies. rupe continu move versu us dollar rang stop currenc appreci beyond accord analyst rupe strengthen past month owe record buy equiti oversea investors. slowdown inflow caus indian rupe lose steam. badrish kulhal life opinion trend fii flow debt equiti give clue way rupe behav along trend trade deficit deficit well. saw strong inflow debt januari februari extent march well. subsequ debt fii flow turn margin neg part reason curb fii short end yield curve. therefor appetit fii dimmed. henc increment debt fii margin neg kulhal told et now. equiti fii flow saw larg amount inflow march post inflow april rel tepid. therefor consequ movement currenc quit sharp till saw around two three week ago. subsequ fii flow taper currenc also stabilis somewher around -. level added. also say rupe lost momentum fii flow trickl down. lesser fii flow put pressur rupe bank told et now. ad rupe resist reserv bank india determin check excess currency. kulhal feel rbi would cautiou let rupe drift far away fair level. need bear mind sinc end februari rbi ad almost billion reserv also seem quit activ soak dollar market whenev rupe approach below. rbi would look possibl volatil capit flow somewher around elect time result investor expect kulhal told et .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>unit nation wake last week attack un base injur two indian peacekeep convey deep concern secur council continu hostil lack polit dialogu troubl nation. india perman repres un wrote letter presid month nigerian ambassador u joy ogwu voic concern attack intern displac person camp bor indian protect nearli civilians. two indian peacekeep injur well-arm - strong mob forc way facil open fire displac person shelter inside. matter deep concern countri despit clear call given unsc resolut neither hostil ceas polit dialogu progress south sudan mukerji said letter date april . consequ increas violent attack especi civilian south sudan said. mukerji stress troop contribut member state includ india unmiss expect deal polit caus hostil violenc result lack polit dialogu south sudan. request india concern brought attent unsc member council give prioriti work achiev polit agreement parti south sudan. note india view essenti prerequisit end hostil south sudan protect live innoc civilian country. india singl largest troop contributor un mission south sudan unmiss last one year seven indian soldier kill attack un bases. un secur council took note india concern seek address issu press statement april follow bor attack call perpetr attack brought justice. mukerji said south sudan agenda secur council given mandat unmiss pass resolut decemb last year call immedi cessat hostil immedi open dialogu south sudan. press statement unsc member call south sudanes govern immedi take step ensur safeti civilian unmiss protect civilian site south sudan swiftli investig incid bring perpetr egregi act justice. council also call parti south sudan allow unmiss fulli implement mandate. member secur council underscor full support unmiss peacekeep commend action unmiss conting bor sought fulfil mandat protect civilians. also call parti refrain action statement could escal situat press statement said. civilian seek protect eight unmiss base south sudan civilian intern displac world youngest country. un secretari gener ban ki-moon strongli condemn attack bor say attack locat civilian protect unit nation seriou escalation. statement issu ban spokesperson said attack un peacekeep unaccept constitut war crime. respons question pti concern safeti indian peacekeep ban spokesperson stephan dujarr said yesterday un much indebt countri contribut troop peacekeep mission south sudan. done work protect ten thousand peopl wouldnt aliv werent work said. ad un repeatedli stress premis need respect safeti un personnel but...mor importantli safeti ten thousand civilian sought un base seek refug violence. unsc member press statement express outrag attack underscor attack civilian un peacekeep may constitut war crime .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item></items>
