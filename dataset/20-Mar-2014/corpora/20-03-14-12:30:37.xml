But a five-week old social app, Secret, is testing the limits of just how much sharing Silicon Valley thinks is a good thing. That's because the sharing is done anonymously. And, as it turns out, much of the chatter is about Silicon Valley itself &#8212; offering a rare, unvarnished look at the ambitions, disappointments, rivalries, jealousies and obsessions of the engineers and entrepreneurs who live and work there.   Secret, like a number of other recent apps, connects people anonymously through their address books. Messages appear only as from "friend" or "friend of friend." Juicy posts that receive a lot of likes or comments also appear occasionally , identified simply by the city or state where they originated. Secret's makers do not reveal download figures and it is not highly ranked on iTunes or Google Play charts. But since the service was introduced less than two months ago, it has gained popularity among early adopters and particularly among the tech crowd. Many of the posts on Secret border on the mundane. But they can also offer a hotbed of Silicon Valley gossip.   Postings express frustrations about valley culture (" I really hope the King IPO is a flop" ), the struggle of raising money (" Battery put us through the wringer , but they never had any intention to invest" ), put forth insider-y tidbits (" Going through a merger is like going on a double date as your friend's wingman" ) and even report the occasional Mark Zuckerberg sighting. Some postings go so far as to target specific people, including prominent members of the tech industry, even though such comments go against the app's guidelines.     Because of the anonymity, it is never clear whether the posts are truthful. That has not seemed to curb the audience for them. A few days ago, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen dashed off a series of messages on Twitter that appeared to be directed at lurid gossip circulating on applications like Secret, although he did not name that app. "Every day, each one of us has many choices about whether to lift people around us up or tear them down," he wrote in a series of tweets. "For most of us, those choices are local in nature &#8212; people we know or meet, interact with face-toface , one-on-one . But for some of us, those choices loom larger, in the social software and systems we design , build, report on, advertise on, fund."   Andreessen declined to comment for this article. But his tweets exploded across Twitter as many weighed in on the value of anonymity and ethics. After his remarks, some on Secret wondered whether his take could be interpreted as sour grapes, perhaps from missing out on the opportunity to invest in the company, although Andreessen's firm, Andreessen Horowitz, declined to comment. Neither Andreessen nor his firm has invested in Secret, but the app has won the wallets of many others.   The company recently announced that it had raised $8.6 million from a number of well-known investors, including Alexis Ohanian, a founder of Reddit, and Bing Gordon of Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byers. Ohanian, who invested as part of his new firm, Initialized Capital, said that "apps like Secret become an outlet for people to speak honestly about things that would otherwise result in career damage." He added that the company also appealed to him as a contender for the future of social networking beyond the scope of Facebook. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>itahar wb trinamool congress chief mamata banerje today warn darjeel allow go andhra pradesh way assert till aliv would give inch land away. attack bjp congress game play andhra pradesh bifurc issu banerje said time would succeed. till aliv give inch land way. interest polit land cannnot cede way. think play game andhra pradesh succeed told elect meet here. banerje outburst follow bjp vice-presid darjeel ls seat ahluwalia support format separ state gorkhaland. ahluwalia today told report darjeel bjp alway support creation smaller state jharkhand chattisgarh favour telangana gorkhaland also formed. banerje accus congress bjp make understand telengana bill said attempt divid bengal would allowed. depend state govern whether state would bifurc consult state govern issu point out. accus bjp pursu commun divis polit congress anti-peopl polici said need chang government. polit make money corrupt polit divid peopl commun line told rally. differ congress bjp. bjp attack upa govern elect round corner said wonder parti parti arm congress-l upa govern issu price rise issues. defend part way nda commun issu walk allianc upa fdi retail .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi senior leader today express willing take bjp prime ministeri candid elect varanasi seat. definitely. pack bag leav tomorrow varanasi desir congress parti told pti ask would consid fight modi come gener elections. sharma remark came amid media known modi-bait aicc gener secretari may chosen take modi varanasi. singh in-charg parti affair long time. howev senior congress leader concern nomin finalis process feign ignor ask possibl singh candidatur seat. sharma commerc industri minist member rajasthan belong himach pradesh brahmin leader. view section parti exit sit bjp mp elector battl holi citi advantag congress field brahmin candidate. joshi keen contest varanasi bjp leadership persuad vacat seat favour modi. joshi fight elect kanpur. put joint front modi varanasi sharma said clear it. congress parti go vacat polit space fight elect symbol candid flag. clash ideologies. wherev modi contest congress fight him...i disciplin soldier congress happi take somebodi like narendra modi. leader decide. congress leadership alreadi consid name three candid varanasi. congress field strong candid fight full strength sharma earlier said address press brief aicc .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
