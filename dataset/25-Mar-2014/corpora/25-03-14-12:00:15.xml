<items><item><body>     Either it is a broadening of his world view or an effect of the compulsions of electoral politics, but as Aam Aadmi Party's founder and leading light    took the plunge into national politics, he observed that communalism was a bigger issue in India than corruption. Interestingly, he said this during an interaction with members of Delhi's India Islamic Centre.   Almost around the same time   , one of the    rebels who jumped ship before the elections, announced on national television that he was quitting the party as he is morally obliged, because of his community, to pursue secular politics.   What is it about Indian Muslims that all politicians or wannabe politicians feel compelled to mouth the usual 'secular-communal' platitudes to win them over? Why do they think that for a Muslim the only worry is communalism? There is no denying the fact that communal politics should be a major concern for all well-meaning Indians (not just Muslims), just as corruption should be. But i am coming round to believe that our biggest worry should be inefficiency borne out of incompetence. And this goes to the root of all our problems.   India's big fortune of having intellectual stalwarts like Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Azad etc at the dawn of Independence has also been its biggest misfortune &#8212; because it gave an exaggerated sense of self to us. Political leaders like these were not representative of the Indian people, a majority of whom were illiterate with only partially-developed intellect.   Over the next few decades, as we tried to reach education to the lowest common denominator, we constantly lowered standards so that the weakest could catch up. As a result the average intellectual capacity of our nation today is determined not by our brightest, but by our dumbest.   This progressive lowering of standards has dangerously permeated every rung of our societal ladder. Take for example the Indian armed forces. Senior army officers admit that over years the standards for officer intake have been lowered so much that today they do not get the kind of youth they did till about 20 years ago. However, they are getting better educated recruits in other ranks.   It is not that officer aspirants are not educated, they may be more qualified in terms of degrees. But this qualification does not add value to their lives or their professions, because it does not feed their intellect. No amount of training or experience can make up for the absence of thinking capacity or imagination. Then how can these officers suddenly become strategists upon promotion?   The same rings true for every other profession in India, whether it is bureaucracy, management or even educational institutions &#8212; all of which are populated, even led by mediocre people with limited thinking faculties. They can memorise well and apply formulas and theories, but they cannot think for themselves, cannot analyse and cannot put the past in the present context to understand the future.   This is extremely worrisome because most of our leadership, political, bureaucratic and industrial is populated by mediocre people. Mediocrity breeds insecurity and that leads to dishonesty. Mediocre people support and promote other mediocre people so that they can all coexist. One doesn't have to search for examples here, they are all around us. In parents who fudge documents so that their kids get an edge over others and in teachers who nudge their students to cheat so that the school's record remains unblemished. So we plagiarise blatantly until we are caught, then we say we were merely inspired! </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>varanasiallahabad withdraw har har modi ghar ghar modi slogan support bjp pm candid varanasi coin new one dil mein modi ghar mein modi kashi ke kan kan mein modi. chant . made new slogan hurt anybodi sentiment said tilak raj mishra support modi citi unit spokesperson. ground zero slogan har har modi may taken life own. modi rath especi assembl lucknow campaign trail. saffron-colour van slogan boldli written them. bjp backtrack slogan sunday swami swaroopanand saraswati express object chief . monday anoth seer shankaracharya puri swami adhokhshayananda made disapprov clear. told toi suit human compar god. har har rever say power-hungri person like modi. seer said modi seek public apolog past misde seek mandat peopl .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi advers polit current tamil nadu may prompt skip financ minist recus could ring major chang decade-old peck order need urgent refit. though congresss dip graph tamil nadu seen reason chidambaram choos caution imprud decis view part gener chang bring new face fore. centr congresss polit polici matrix chidambaram may remain parti lead voic economi financ minist much upa tenur sinc . chidambaram profil declin could promin leader long occupi top slot manmohan singh govern manag key ministeri assignments. chidambaram decis also odd parti leadership field veteran like amarind singh ambika soni ghulam nabi azad precis counter impress leader duck lok sabha polls. emerg assess congress chang guard seem inevit need fresh think top felt ahead demand elect test parti bog corrupt inflation. new current work may discern parti manifesto -like releas week- may reveal alter polici formul structur issu relat economi seen fumbled. apart chidambaram member cabinet committe secur like face dimunit roles. prime minist manmohan singh announc retir home minist sushil shind may consid current assign event congress beat predict form government. sourc point even congress move opposit bench new order certain emerge. part due rahul gandhi assum command also current formul look jaded. foreign minist salman khurshid defenc minist k antoni may also find alter roles. though composit congress core committe - chidambaram antoni singh member - unlik chang immedi new think clearli cards. similarli senior member govern may enjoy quit spotlight irrespect congresss success failur elect .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item></items>
