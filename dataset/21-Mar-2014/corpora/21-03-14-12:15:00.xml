Bharat Ram Academic Complex at    on Thursday.  The Tibetan leader also spoke to students on 'success, ethics and happiness' stating "technology is no guarantee of a better world. Material wealth fails to bring happiness. Pay more attention to inner wealth."   Speaking about the present education system, the Tibetan leader said, "Existing education is not enough. There is need to promote love and compassion. The modern education system is geared towards material wealth." Complimenting India and its secular fabric while being critical of the level of corruption, he said: "I am a messenger of ancient Indian thought and tradition of non-violence and compassion. India is a living example of religious harmony and secular ethics. The Indian Constitution is based on secularism. However,    in a religious country like India is a big contradiction."   The    for Peace is an extension to the library. It is a centre for research and learning having meeting rooms, audio-visual equipment and individual workstations. An online library will be launched here soon. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>atting atting win ground congress later becam formid cpim bastion set wit blaze battl cpim sit mp
