Some places in    already know what separates the men from the boys.   The Big Mac wants a bigger share of the fast food market. Not content with being seen as a kids' hangout place, McDonald's is all set to launch their Royale range -- big-size burgers for adults. Priced at Rs 130-135, the burgers promise to be bigger. But will they be better?   Chef John, head chef at    in   , tells us what goes into making a good burger. He says, "There are five points to keep in mind. Grind your own meat, get the right ratio between lean meat and fat (80:20), do not overcook the patty, keep it juicy and always use freshly baked buns."   So, if you want quality as well as quantity, we bring you some of the best burgers in town that are sure to please an adult palate.     A delicious chunk of salmon is not what most of us expect to find between bread, but if you like your grub with a bit of glam, Indigo Deli is the place for you. Served with wedges and salad, the salmon burger is a must-try.       Between Breads Between Breads is always packed. What makes them so popular? Their no-frills outlook to food. Their Ten-Ounce Bacon burger is a beef patty-fried eggbacon-gouda-onion ring creation that is love in every mouthful.       Big Nasty's All American Beef Burger is classic quarter pounder marinated in Worcestershire sauce, crushed pepper and fresh garlic. It is done medium rare and served with a fried egg and cheese.       Hardcore burger enthusiasts will probably roll their eyes when we recommend a chicken burger, but Three Wise Men proves that yes, a chicken burger can cut it. Their Patty Melt is definitely not for children. The chicken patty is marinated for a whole day in beer, before it is grilled and served with emmental, gherkins and jalapeno mayo.       Woodside Inn's burger stands out in particular because they use brioche buns. The juicy beef patty is nestled on a bed of lettuce, tomatoes and onions with a generous helping of English cheddar cheese and sweet mustard.   , Partner, Neighbourhood Hospitality, says, "This is our signature burger and every element has been designed to bring out the best flavors. Plus, we use real English Cheddar &#8212; not the processed kind."   </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>share india sun pharmaceut industri ltd gain much . per cent ad . per cent rise monday broker upgrad stock sun agre buy ranbaxi laboratori ltd . billion. sun pharma head biggest single-day per centag gain sinc may . ub upgrad sun pharma buy neutral rais target rs rs wednesday cite expect contribut earn ranbaxy. believ deal make sens given limit overlap sun ranbaxi india sun limit presenc row rest world market ub said report date tuesday ad sun would abl cut administr research develop costs. monday bank america merril lynch also upgrad sun pharma buy neutral cite higher price-to-earn multipl ranbaxi acquisition. ranbaxi share gain . per cent .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>afghanistan presidenti elect like enter runoff stage mark first peac transit power afghan history. ravag endless war sinc . despit year blood-let peac come afghanistan free extern albatross turn curs nation. sure presid hamid karzai successor work cut includ promot nation reconcili build bridg countri dispar ethnic polit group strengthen still-fledgl multi-ethn afghan armi ensur free fair parliamentari elect next year. role extern player howev overshadow intern dynamics. afghanistan polit secur transit hing consider two factor level interfer pakistan still harbour milit sanctuari command-and-control structur afghan insurg like post- role us-l forces. big part afghanistan problem. pakistani non-interfer afghanistan intern affair occur washington final make condit continu gener aid cash-strap pakistan - remot prospect. inde presid barack obama u-turn nato militari presenc afghanistan - want long-term base - welcom news pakistani generals. keep afghan insurg aliv thu pakistan-nurtur milit group busi also safeguard us multi billion-aid flow sustain us need pakistani militari cooperation. obama declar cairo want keep troop afghanistan. seek militari base there. chang heart obama seek base virtual unlimit period hous fairli sizabl us-l nato forc arm author conduct combat operations. suppos endgam afghanistan turn new game long-term base strategy. howev fail persuad karzai sign bilater secur agreement provid legal basi keep us base indefinit obama must win next president. although kabul washington finalis agreement term karzai withstood intens us pressur sign document leav critic decis successor. karzai clearli didnt want go afghan histori main facilit long-term foreign militari presence. us militarili interven countri penchant leaving. fact iraq prove except pattern made appeal particularli strong washington maintain base afghanistan america seek termin longest war histori .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item></items>
