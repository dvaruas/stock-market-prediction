But if there is one member of the team - though not officially recognised as such - who works equally hard and keeps a cool head, it's the politician's pilot.   From bullying to tardiness, pilots are witness to it all. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Gopinath Munde's followers recently beat up Captain Utpal Banerjee in Maharashtra's Beed district. All he wanted was more time for clearances with Munde changing the itinerary at the last minute.   While this is a one-off case, the pressure on pilots is unrelenting. "Helicopter pilots are under tremendous stress during elections," says Banerjee, adding that his company Millennium Air (owned by    Group) was pursing the complaint registered with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Election Commission.   Bearing with uncertainty and brickbats is not all. Veteran civil helicopter pilot, Captain UC Yadav, once waited six hours for a yesteryear actor contesting from Bihar to turn up.   But not all politicians fall under this bracket. Colonel Srivastava counts   ,    and    among the more punctual and organised. Captain Yadav, who has flown politicians in the 2004 and 2009 general elections, says    typically turned up five minutes before the allotted time.     Even when pilots are briefed about travel plans in advance, delays are possible. A common reason is wrong coordinates &#8212; the latitude and longitude of the helipad &#8212; given by district administration.   Srivastava recalls how, three years ago, he had to spend a night at a petrol pump near Kanpur because the flight coordinates to the    where he was supposed to refuel were 10 km off the actual location.   As a result, he had to land at the next location and wait for the fuel vehicle. Since he couldn't leave the helicopter unattended, he covered it, tied it up and went to a petrol pump nearby. The politician, of course, left immediately by road. These days, of course, pilots are grateful for apps like Google Maps.     Besides logistical hurdles, many permits are required to fly. The zonal Air Authority of India, Indian Air Force and district administration of every place the aircraft wants to land at have to approve plans. In addition, pilots need to plan whether to dispatch refuelling vehicles to the location where they will land, depending on the number of places to visit and the number of people boarding the aircraft.   Fortunately, politicans these days understand. "DGCA and Election    have become strict with the rules," says Colonel Srivastava.     Apart from managing the politician on board, a pilot has to guard his vehicle from unwarranted attention on the ground. Srivastava remembers ward ing off people at a populous location near Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, despite police being deployed. "At one point I had to hit people with a slipper," he says.   Through all these perils, they aren't calling it quits yet - the job gives them enough thrills to carry on. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>sydney australian offici said wednesday two new ping signal detect search miss flight inject fresh confid search struggl lack information. head australian agenc coordin search said one ping detect tuesday afternoon last five minut second second pick tuesday night last seven minutes. believ search right area need visual identifi aircraft wreckag confirm certainti final rest place mh houston told report perth. weekend u.s. navi tow pinger locat pick two signal consist black box locat beacon - first two hour second minutes. black box record cockpit data may provid answer happen plane carri passeng crew vanish march flew thousand kilometr kuala lumpur-to-beij route. batteri beacon alreadi reach end -day expect life make effort swiftli locat critical. author say evid suggest plane deliber divert someon familiar aircraft rule mechan problems. analysi satellit data led investig conclud came remot area near perth. search centr area approxim kilometr mile northwest city. houston said new signal may allow offici narrow search area point autonom underwat vehicl name bluefin- onboard ocean shield could sent look wreckag sea floor. hope lot transmiss well tight small area hope matter day abl find someth bottom said .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
