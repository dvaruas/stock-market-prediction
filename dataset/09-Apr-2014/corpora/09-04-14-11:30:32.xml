Canadian researchers examined 26 US and Canadian studies that included a total of more than 1,000 people.   Their analysis showed that one daily serving (3/4 cup) of legumes &#8212; beans, chickpeas, lentils and peas&#8212; was linked to a reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5 per cent.   The study could not confirm cause-and-effect, but did show a strong association. The 5 per cent reduction in LDL cholesterol suggests a potential 5 per cent lower risk of heart disease, according to a team led by Dr John Sievenpiper, of the Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Center at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto.   The heart-healthy effect of legumes was greater in men than women, the research found. That may be because men tend to have worse eating habits and higher cholesterol levels to begin with than women, so they might gain more from    to a healthier diet.   Some of the study participants reported stomach problems such as bloating, flatulence, constipation or diarrhea as a result of eating legumes.   Nevertheless, nutrition experts were quick to sing the praises of the lowly bean, pea and lentil. "It's time to spill the beans. By making a small dietary change, such as consuming one serving a day of beans, chickpeas, lentils and    &#8212; as most of the world does already &#8212; we can make a modest risk reduction in our incidence of heart disease by lowering our 'bad cholesterol' LDL, especially in men," said Dr Robert Graham, an internist and natural remedy specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.   He said the study analysis was "methodologically strong," with people being followed for at least three weeks to test the effect of legume intake on health. According to Graham, that three-week threshold is the same the US Food and Drug Administration uses when it evaluates any    that claims to help lower cholesterol.   Dana Angelo White is a sports dietitian and assistant clinical professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut. She called legumes "one of the most underappreciated sources of protein out there. They are loaded with hungerfighting fiber and protein, so I am not surprised to see the results of this study." </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>sandeep wagl sell call target rs stop loss rs .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>ranchi four constitu locat stronghold go tomorrow first phase amid tight secur measures. lok sabha seat jharkhand four constitu -- sc chatra koderma lohardaga st-- go poll tomorrow. total elector men women elig exercis franchis first phase poll. poll remain lok sabha seat would held april . candid fray palamau ls seat three-corn contest card bjp candid former jharkhand polic chief vishnu dayal ram rjd manoj kumar jharkhand vika morcha ghuran ram. trinamool congress make debut state lok sabha elect former maoist baitha contest candid palamau congress won six times. promin candid fray former union minist congress candid rameshwar oraon sit bjp mp sudarshan bhagat lohardaga st seat bjp state unit chief ravindra kumar ray former congress mp tilakdhari singh. least seven chopper press servic first phase elect accord return officer-cum-deputi commission palamau kripanand jha .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>like set cutoff . per cent auction . per cent -day t-bill wednesday accord thomson reuter poll traders. -day yield expect lower previou auction improv cash condit trader said. maximum cut-off yield . per cent minimum . per cent -day t-bill poll. maximum cut-off . per cent minimum . per cent -day t-bills. rbi auction rs crore -day t-bill rs crore -day t-bills. rbi set cut-off . per cent rs . -day t-bill previou auction last week. previou cut-off -day t-bill . per cent rs . .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>madurai assail inclus contenti issu like construct ram templ ayodhya bjp manifesto today said deliber design polaris voter mind majoritarian approach ignor vote party. said concern issu ram templ imposit uniform civil code abrog special statu controversi would divid countri disrupt social harmony. bjp dont care vote section people. agenda get major votes. seem decid dont requir vote minorities. approach majoritarian senior leader told press confer here. said bjp manifesto talk reserv policy. state stand reserv polici accept polit parti import polici said. chidambaram accus bjp enact drama past year appear kept issu back burner. appear rais poison thought bjp want polaris voter elections. seem keen get consolid vote bank tell vote want vote chidambaram said. senior congress leader said consolid vote bank reflect bjp majoritarian approach. charg bjp deliber attempt polaris voters. think care peopl vote them. want mere consolid vote bank .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>pune refut suggest alleg dictatori attitud could antagonis alli bjp presid today said question find accept compromis prime ministeri candid event. narendra modi prime ministeri candid bjp-led nda. question find accept prime ministeri candid compromis come power told report here. singh ask percept modi dictatori mindset could lead constitu oppos name top job. rule eventu stoutli defend modi say dictatori attitud would popularli elect gujarat chief minister. bjp presid also brush asid talk parti leader arun jaitley becom deputi prime minist nda came power . singh claim number parti pledg support nda gone latest entrant tdp maintain bjp-led front pois get clear majority. queri bjp chief said issu mention parti manifesto within framework indian constitution. singh also defend bjp gener secretari close modi aid fire alleg hate speech reject charg recent remark poll ralli uttar pradesh commun overtones. ask modi would abl keep constitu nda togeth sustain govern like atal bihari vajpaye done event head bjp-led coalit govern elect singh said nda coalit govern modi would problems. comparison two individuals. atalji atalji modi modi said .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
