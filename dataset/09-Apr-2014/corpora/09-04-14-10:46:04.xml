The demonstration was made at Microsoft's Think Next symposium in    recently. With the company having plans for mass production, this technology could change the way we interact with portable electronics, and perhaps even help realise the dream of a fast-charging electric car.   As we all know only too well, recharging our portable electronics can take a painfully long time. This is because reversing the chemical reactions that caused the battery to deplete is a process that can hardly be rushed, for considerations of both safety and energy efficiency. But now, a radically new battery design advanced by StoreDot could bring charge times down to the order of a few seconds.   The company produces so-called nanodots, chemically synthesised bio-organic peptide molecules that, thanks to their small size, improve ele c t rode capaci -tance and electrolyte performance. The result is batteries that can be fully charged in seconds rather than hours. 'In essence, we have developed a new generation of electrodes with new materials &#8212; we call it Multi Function Electrode," StoreDot CEO Doron Myersdorf said.   The company says that unlike other nanodot and quantum-dot technologies that are heavy metal based, making them toxic, its nanodots are made from a vast range of bio-organic raw materials that are environmentally-friendly. These materials are also naturally abundant, and the nanodots employ a basic biological mechanism of self-assembly, making them cheap to manufacture. StoreDot is in the process of submitting patents for the technology, and mass production of the smartphone batteries is planned for late 2016. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
