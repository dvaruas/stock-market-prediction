<items><item><body> BANGALORE: Imagine a world where people sit at home, make clothes through their tablets, visualize them, get measured through technology, and then have a factory to dispatch the garment.   Think fashion retail; think co-creation is what Arvind Ltd, India's $1-billion textile and apparel major, is excited about these days. Arvind recently set up consumer internet division in Bangalore, with custom clothing touted as differentiator in the rapidly expanding domestic e-tailing.   "We are looking at online in different ways with a focus on blue-sky innovation as well as leveraging on the brick and click model," said Kulin Lalbhai, executive director of Arvind Ltd and younger son of company chairman Sanjay Lalbhai.   The 28 year-old Kulin &#8212; an MBA from Harvard and electrical engineering graduate out of Stanford &#8212; is spearheading Arvind's online foray beginning next fiscal, but refuses to divulge on specifics keeping the venture a closely a guarded secret.   Arvind has up to 35% share of India's apparel sales, with 1,000 retail stores. It made the country's first denim brand in Flying Machine and gave India its first international brand in Arrow over two-decades ago. But the younger Lalbhai believes that the next inflection point for Arvind will be in the digital space.   "Digital is going to change the landscape. As a retailer who is going to dominate the space of brick it is crucial for us to embrace click and give that seamless experience," said Lalbhai, while suggesting that Arvind would unleash disruptive innovations in custom clothing.   Arvind's latest joint venture tie-up with Goodhill Corporation of Japan, a suit manufacturer with over 40%    of customized clothing in that country, is a part of this digital push.   Kulin personally scripted the JV company Arvind Goodhill Suit Manufacturing with a manufacturing unit in Bangalore. The $2-billion domestic suits market is growing at 30% annually, but organized    cater only one-third of this market.   The JV factory with an investment of Rs 40 crore has a capacity to produce 3.5 lakh pieces of jackets and 6 lakh pairs of trousers annually. While Arvind plans to utilize a lion's share of this production capacity for exports, Lalbhai added, "We have built this facility in such a way that it can even be a 100% custom suits plant."   The initial strategy involves pushing Arvind branded custom suits, but it would soon embrace the company's large portfolio of fashion apparel brands.   For Sanjay Lalbhai's second son, disruptive innovations in custom clothing will not be restricted to India alone. "Arvind is now at a scale where India is not the end game. Today, I can get a garment to New York in a day, so why does India alone matter," said Lalbhai. </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>ye form. know definit core middl last year mani becam extrem attract whether look larsen &amp; toubro varieti compani pretti cheap. look back compani goe go cycles. mani stock quot probabl price book five time even six time assum india infrastructur growth continu forever. middl last year mani stock avail close one time book compani fairli good balanc sheet also. even thing work immedi futur find risk own buy work well still lot upsid left mani stocks. posit fundament strong compani balanc sheet good order flow may slow right go ahead pick .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>seoul fell lowest level week tuesday sell foreign institut amid escal tension . kospi close . per cent . point tuesday mark lowest close level sinc feb. . foreign investor sold net . billion won . million worth institut offload total . billion won .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>mumbai rupe trim initi loss still trade lower pais . us dollar late morn deal today bout demand american currenc bank importers. domest currenc resum lower . per dollar previou close . interbank foreign exchang forex weaken . sustain dollar demand importers. rupe quot . per dollar hours. hover rang .-. per dollar late morn deals. new york dollar trade higher major rival late yesterday. meanwhil bse sensex trade higher . point . per cent . hour .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>ye earlier show say fairli strong growth -- requir cyclic slowdown mani product happening. given fact gener economi slow high mean certain peopl comfort buy leverag postpon impact sales. said done realli look long term need automobil whether two wheeler car structur requir mani vehicl smaller town citi see that. best need identifi compani well posit term kind product sell. someth need research overal quit okay slowdown continu posit sector .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>bangalor consortium led limit won maiden railway project. rs crore project involv construct rail line doubl jhansi bhimsen station state uttar pradesh india. part asset light strategi happi announc first foray promis railway construct sector. win reflect long term vision build epc expertis nich segment like railway pave way similar project futur say arun kumar sharma ceo urban infrastructur &amp; highway expressed. gmr member consortium tata project partner ohe track work s&amp;t work respectively. project schedul commenc nd april expect complet months. rail vika nigam limit issu letter award gmr consortium th feb . project work includ construct roadb major &amp; minor bridg track link outdoor s&amp;t work ohe tss &amp; gener electr work jhansi erich road. gmr share work valu around rs crore. gmr infrastructur bangalor headquart major interest airport energi highway urban infrastructur sectors. compani power gener asset road asset oper development. airport sector compani oper india busiest airport indira gandhi intern airport new delhi also develop commiss airport hyderabad .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item></items>
