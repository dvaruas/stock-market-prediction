Many would flinch at the thought. After all, how can you put your money for the retirement corpus in an instrument that invests in equities? They are volatile. So you can lose money. But what if the plan promises capital protection along with guaranteed maturity benefits?   As per the new regulations, a unit-linked pension plan, or ULPP, has to assure that the principle invested is secured, that is, you can never lose the money you invest. So, the premiums paid throughout the policy term are safe. The worst that can happen is no profit, which in a long-term    like insurance is highly improbable. Plus, you have the guaranteed maturity benefits. Some insurers promise up to 195% of all premiums paid. This guarantee however would differ and depend upon the    payment option (single or regular premium plan), policy term and the fund option you choose. Here, many would ask why buy an equity-oriented plan if all you need is stability that is best offered by a debt instrument. The answer to this is simple&#8212;a debt can never give as high returns as equities in the long-run.   score over other debt plans as the policyholder has the option of benefiting from equity exposure. So, over the long term, the unit-linked plans have potential to generate better returns. On the other hand, the guarantee component ensures that the insurer to play safer (invest a good chunk in debt) than they would with a regular aggressive equity fund. A combination of equity and debt help you build an adequate retirement corpus and protect your savings from market downturns. In other words, this insurance plan helps you protect your savings from market downturns through the assured benefits while you can still invest in the equity market to get superior returns.   ULPPs are flexibility products and let you choose the level of equity exposure based on your    appetite, age and the years left in your retirement. They offer a range of equity exposure, with funds with up to 100 per cent equity investments. So, if you are in your early accumulation stage and have a long-time before you retire you could take more risk and have more equity leaning. While if you are nearing retirement, you could choose a more conservative debt-heavy option. Also, this is not a onetime choice. You can use the free fund    option and alter your fund mix during the policy years as well. While some companies have limited number of switches per year, many offer unlimited switches.   Since these are basically unit-linked plans (ULIPs), the basic structure and cost have to be the same as mandated for ULIPs. This means there are caps on charges and commissions, which are evenly distributed through the policy term. This ensures better return than a product which is front-loaded and most of the first-year premium is allocated towards charges and commissions. Like ULIPs, these plans also have a lock-in period of five years and the maximum surrender charge is capped at Rs 6,000. So, if a plan is discontinued before five years, the insurer can't charge a penalty over this Rs 6,000.   In case of any retirement product, it compulsory to buy annuity at maturity. The new rules say that the same insurer, who you bought the pension policy from, should also provide you the annuity plan. This makes the buying process seamless and hassle free. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
