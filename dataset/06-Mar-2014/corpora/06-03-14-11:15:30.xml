<items><item><body>NEW DELHI: In a clear indication of the significant amounts of    in   , 30 per cent of lawmakers spent less than 50 per cent of their   .   In fact, only two lawmakers &#8212; Samajwadi Party's Premdas from Etawah constituency and Akhilesh Yadav &#8212; exceeded their election expenses. While Premdas spent Rs 57.39 lakh (230 per cent of the expense limit), Yadav (Uttar Pradesh CM from Kannauj constituency) spent Rs 26.73 lakh (107 per cent of the expense limit).   Election expense declarations analyzed by Association for Democratic Reforms reveal that the average amount of money spent by 437 MPs in the    election 2009 is only about Rs 14.62 lakh or 59 per cent of the expense limit.   The government recently cleared a proposal of the    to raise the expenditure limits for Lok Sabha elections from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 70 lakh for each Lok Sabha constituency in bigger states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Karnataka and from Rs 22 lakh in smaller states like Goa to Rs 54 lakh on par with other hilly and north eastern states. The Government also cleared the proposal to raise expenditure limits for assembly elections, with a maximum of Rs 28 lakh and a minimum of Rs 20 lakh in North Eastern and hill states.   However, spending patterns show that neither MPs nor legislators end up spending the entire amount. Even the recent five assembly elections -- in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh-- show that on an average, MLAs declare an expenditure that is far lower than the limit set, at 50 per cent of the expense limit. In Delhi, MLAs declared an average expenditure of about 51 per cent of the expense limit, in Chhattisgarh 53 per cent, in Madhya Pradesh 48 per cent, in Rajasthan 46 per cent and in Mizoram 55 per cent.   According to ADR founder Prof Trilochan Sastry, "Raising the ceiling does not address the real issues. First, we need a level playing ground so that any public minded citizen with a desire for public service should be able to contest elections and not be at a disadvantage. Raising the ceiling has no impact on that. Second, we need more transparency in the funding and source of funding, along with penalties for not being transparent. This is also not addressed. Third, we need penalties for crossing the new limit of Rs 70 lakh. This is also not taken care of. We need to curb this blatant misuse of black money in elections. In summary, none of the major concerns are addressed by the Cabinet decision to raise the ceiling."   Other details revealed indicated that 317 MPs (73 per cent) were not funded by their political party while only 120 MPs (27 per cent) were funded by the political party and only 15 MPs (3 per cent) declared that all of their expenditure was funded by the political party which fielded him/her.   Samajwadi Party MPs toted up the highest election expenses in the 2009 election with an average spending of Rs 19.48 lakh (78 per cent of the election expense) followed by BJP and Congress that both spent Rs 14.38 lakh or 59 per cent of their expenses while BSP spent Rs 14.72 lakh or 59 per cent of its election expense. </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>buy target rs stop loss rs .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>buy target rs stop loss rs .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>buy target rs stop loss rs .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>shanghai china strengthen third straight session thursday domin amid sign central bank stay sidelin allow chines currenc recov recent weakness. dollar purchas state bank sign intervent design weaken yuan -- appear subsid week free currenc revers larg chunk loss sinc mid-januari trader said. pboc may feel reach goal warn currenc specul engin latest round yuan depreci said dealer european bank shanghai. market believ yuan may stabilis near term possibl stage decent rebound return linger long-term trend currenc appreciate. stood . per dollar midday . percent stronger wednesday close pboc fix offici midpoint margin higher . wednesday . possibl anoth sign central bank would will let yuan stabilis now. longer term world second-largest economi still face heavi capit inflow current account capit account mean yuan still potenti appreci gradual trader said. relat develop pboc purchas . billion yuan billion worth foreign exchang net basi januari accord reuter calcul base pboc data releas wednesday. sharpli . billion bought decemb indic step offici intervent yuandollar trade trader said. pboc state bank consist bought foreign currenc flow countri past decad help govern control pace yuan appreci dollar. pboc also surpris global market year engin sharp declin yuan. last week yuan suffer biggest-ev weekli declin around . per cent cap largest monthli loss . per cent february. variou specul purpos pboc latest move academ criticis intervent trade call freer convertibility. essenti method curb hot money inflow maintain financi stabil central bank stop interven foreign exchang market let yuan appreci proper level yu yongd influenti research chines academi social scienc said. yu also academ advisor central bank made written comment respons interview request reuter .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item></items>
