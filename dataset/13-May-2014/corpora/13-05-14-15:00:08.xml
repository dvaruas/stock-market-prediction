If we get a confirmation of the exit poll numbers in the final results, then you will see better times ahead. While the near-term market will be a function of what final print we see on Friday, if a government with a very strong mandate actually assumes power, then this market has a lot more room to move higher over the months to come.    We do not have year-end targets for the Sensex, but it is very reasonable to assume that typically this market always trades much higher. Whatever news of growth, development or recovery you start hearing, you will see that getting reflected into the upgrade cycle. So right now it has largely been a function of the markets moving from below average PE to slightly above average PE, but the more important thing will be how the growth plays out in the market from here.     Yes, that is a very high probability. If you see the election results being very similar to what the exit polls are, then those Nifty levels are something which in our view is a very high probable event for us to see the market trading in.    Yes, because there is one way to see that many of these stocks are up 50-70% from these lows. But if you plot most of these charts over a five-year term, they had also come off almost 50-70% right from financials to infra to capital goods. So even if they are up 50-70% from their lows, they are still down more than 50% from their highs.  Being cyclicals, they typically ride the whole cycle and we have not seen any fundamental improvement playing out yet into these names. So this is right now respecting the event which is happening, which is giving rise to hopes that ultimately, the fundamentals will change and as and when those changes in the cyclicals happen, you will see them further riding higher from here.     Some change is there in the price for many of these names. That is why most of them are up by almost 50-60% from their lows of the last six months. But these stocks have really not done anything for a very long period of time and if hope starts translating into reality &#8212; for example if diesel under-recovery almost becomes nil, if there is gas price hike, more rationality on the production side &#8212; then ONGC is one of the cheapest upstream stocks that you can find in the globe with a very good balance sheet and very high dividend yield.  Same is the case with HP or BP. While these stocks typically move in a very short period of time, this may be the time when the next five years' business improvement could be different from the last 10 years. At least that is the expectation from the rally of these stocks.    This market will throw a lot of interesting, attractive midcap opportunities. As the new government will start announcing their business plans, development plans, sectors rebounding from their lows, many of the midcaps will also do very well. The last couple of weeks have seen shades of those midcaps doing well. But I agree with you, the midcap index being lower than the highs is itself an indication of how much rally can happen. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi taken seriou note compani entertain claim drag case repeatedli take adjourn say high headedness. west delhi district consum disput redress forum presid bimla makin made observ direct tata aig compani ltd rohit kumar settl claim delhi resid whose car insur pay rs compensation. defici servic high headed insur compani receiv premium insur claim entertain custom approach forum redress grievanc case drag seek adjourn send munshi clerks. take seriou view conduct opposit party. complaint allow forum said. forum also compris member smita shankar pass order complaint file insur compani agent. singh said complaint car insur insur compani met accid decemb approach firm told polici cancel without cite reason. told forum polici rs paid rs . advis compani get vehicl repair file claim. file claim get car repair outsid neither receiv repli compani claim settl singh said ad spent rs repairs. forum note sinc time file complaint either munshi proxi counsel appear behalf insur compani seek adjourn advoc contest case inspit file vakalatnama. said even full premium paid polici cancel unilater without give opportun complain pay balanc amount least intim polici cancel .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
