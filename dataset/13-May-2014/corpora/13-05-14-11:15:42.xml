<items><item><body> Absolutely, if these projections were to come true, you are going to see the    fly.  We are going to see a monster of a   . I am not talking about the immediate short term, but from a three to five-year point of view, you are going to see the markets going up only. Fundamentals will come later, the market would try to price in most of the positives that a very stable government can provide and chief among them being GST because it is only the BJP's states which were resisting the GST and that could add, as some imminent industrialists say, 1.5% to 2% of GDP. That could change the entire scenario. The decisive call would only be taken on 16th when you see the actual numbers. These are all projections whereby most of the    are saying that you have a full fledged majority. I    that is not priced in the market.  It will. You could see the market in fact touch 7800 to 8000 just after these numbers. If these numbers were to come true, you could see the markets fly. The only dilemma is that the most hated names on the street in terms of stock names are the ones which are giving you the best returns today. So how do you position your portfolio, whether you jump into these names or whether you stick to your philosophy of quality growth? As of now we are not doing anything till 16th because exit polls have got it horribly wrong in 2004 and 2009, but the caveat is they have got the assembly results in terms of exit polls fairly correct.    Yes, nobody predicted an AAP win except in Delhi. Have you seen the other states? They have more or less got it right, but the caveat is, in 2009 they got it wrong, in 2004 they got it wrong. But given the turnaround in voter preference &#8212; and most people are quite vocal if they want to have a change &#8212; then yes, the exit polls seem to be right.    I would not agree with that, because there is a long way to go. These numbers will really take the markets to newer levels not only in the immediate short term, but even in the next one to three or five years point of view. This may be just the beginning of a very-very strong bull market. Yes, we are talking of 7100, but 7000 could be the floor on the Nifty.     It is like driving by looking at the rear view mirror. You have got to think as to how the things could play out in the event of a change in government. GST is the next big event and that could throw the entire earnings picture into a tizzy because you know that the number of taxes are going to go down; the cumulative impact of those taxes which you pay today are going to be lesser than what you are going to pay if you are paying today. It is not going to be entirely passed on to the consumers. So you are looking at a margin expansion and markets really reward margin expansion generously. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>san francisco twitter monday began let user mute post peopl interest hear popular one-to-mani messag service. new mute featur expect roll twitter account come weeks. mute user youd like hear less twitter manag paul rosania said blog post. mute user know youv mute cours unmut time. featur ad twitter iphon android applic well twitter.com site access comput web browsers. mute someon twitter stop messag tweet servic pop timelin whoever hit virtual button accord rosania. push text messag mute twitter account delivered. peopl still abl see re-tweet comment twitter post mute person mute loop activity. mute give even control content see twitter let remov user content key part twitter experi rosania said .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>nse india vix fell much . per cent head biggest single-day fall sinc august exit poll result show bharatiya janata parti alli head major elections. surg lead-up investor brace potenti neg surprise. howev project major reinforc market expectations. index rose much . per cent record high . broader index surg . per cent record high . .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
