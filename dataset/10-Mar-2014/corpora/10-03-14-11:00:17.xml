BJP is keen to reach an accommodation with the RJD leader except that it has considered the Pataliputra seat for a Ramdev    and another constituency may not suit Yadav.   Ramkripal is one of several individuals and parties headed for BJP as the main opposition has emerged the clear frontrunner with opinion polls giving NDA between 210 and 235 Lok Sabha seats.   The gravitational pull of the perceived winner has seen LJP chief    forget his harsh criticism of BJP and Narendra Modi and stitch up a seven-seat deal in Bihar.   In a remarkable achievement, BJP has managed to position itself as a credible player even in Tamil Nadu, bargaining with DMDK chief Vijaykanth and PMK's S Ramadoss.   If the PMK and DMDK alliance happens, BJP, along with MDMK's Vaiko, will be in the reckoning for around 7-10 seats, an unheard of development in the southern state long dominated by Dravidian giants DMK and AIADMK.   If the desertion of a long-time aide of RJD chief Lalu Prasad is a matter of satisfaction for the BJP, Ramkripal is only one of many who have eyed the    party with favour.   On its part, keen to blunt criticism that Modi's leadership has increased BJP's isolation, the party has been    to receiving foes-turned-friends and is scouring around for new partners.   MP Jagdambika Pal is headed to BJP having expressed the view that Congress's "emerging leadership" does not seem to have time for him. Former minister D Purandeswari &#8212; daughter of the late NTR &#8212; has already joined BJP.   Aware that regional parties like BJD, Trinamool and AIADMK might wait till the Lok Sabha results to decide whether they will ally with a national party or look for a third front option, BJP is sewing up deals with smaller parties. It is in negotiation with three small Odisha parties and is likely to share seats with two caste-based outfits in UP.   BJP leaders see big gains in Haryana, but have held back from reuniting with old ally and INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala in view of his conviction in a corruption case and his failure to get regular bail.   Asom Gana Parishad is also keen on an alliance but BJP's state unit has been sceptical of the benefits. Yet, BJP leaders are looking at a seat-sharing formula that gives the saffron party a majority of seats. An alliance is seen to be necessary to challenge Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi who has put together a formidable vote bank.   Two senior    leaders, Chandramohan Patwary and Hiten Goswami, will join BJP on Monday morning in the presence of party president   . </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>jsw steel ltd buy call target rs stop loss rs .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
