But no one knows who is saying what because the comments are anonymous. "It spread pretty fast," says Nickolaus Hines, a junior at the school in the US state of Alabama. "The majority of things are jokes or things which are obviously funny," said the 21-year-old. But "some... are pretty mean."   Yik Yak, which allows smartphone users to see posts in a radius up to 8km, is part of a flurry of new apps that offer novel ways to interact on social networks without revealing one's identity. But while some laud these new platforms, others blame them for false rumours, stress and even suicide.   "Anonymity is a beautiful thing," Yik Yak claims. "It gives people a blank slate to work from, effectively removing all preconceptions about them." Apps of this kind are certainly raising eyebrows in Silicon Valley and beyond. Secret, launched last year, recently raised $8.6 million in   . Whisper, which has been around for almost two years, claims 2.5 billion page views for its service. It has raised a reported $21 million.   It said the app springs from "a deep belief that the way people share and interact with each other is changing." Other anonymity apps include PostSecret and the brand new Rumr. A real-time chat service, Rumr says "it's like having a conversation with the lights off." Ask.fm, a Latvian-based group, says 35 million people have downloaded its anonymous sharing app since June 2013 in more than a dozen countries. "Ask.fm gives people a chance to communicate and not to be afraid that their views," said spokeswoman Liva Biseniece.   Some say the move to anonymity is a response to a growing ability to track people's activities and social network posts &#8212; in some cases leading to lasting reputation damage. "I think these apps are creating a safe    for people to share their thoughts and opinions," says Daniel Odio, a senior vice president at the social media plug-in Share who follows social networking trends. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>level function momentum right now. would remain - level run-up elect result trade would quit easi peopl pick up. everi fortnight market build gain time come closer elect result date wont easi trade left. peopl want bet elect outcom make brave call take exposures. right opinion poll dictat trend. least run elect result gain made. good news price. good news start come market gradual respond that. absolut level determin euphor market pe decide. pe right times. earn improv macro happen last four-fiv months. elect ralli expect becom big catalyst. depend upon elect outcom see market move either sideway consensu outcom downsid market get higher. coupl quarter back discuss rang market last year levels. even assum earn growth - least rang shift accordingli extent. big event like elect trade either side .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>mumbai debt-ridden surg nearli per cent trade far follow report compani plan rais nearli rs crore list german arm lse. compani plan sell share german subsidiari senvion se erstwhil rais rs -crore list lse report toi. accord report compani dilut per cent stake senvion meet uk list norm expect rs -crore valuat crown jewel. share sale like biggest offer rupe term indian firm global market recent years. suzlon energi debt rs crore book make loss last three year due global econom slow-down. also unabl pay bondhold due slowdown global markets. suzlon order book billion global instal capac mw fourth india drop two posit becom world seventh largest wind turbin manufactur due contract tradit strong home us accord annual btm world market updat report. februari auditor suzlon energi rais issu like wind turbin maker abil gener adequ cash flow support operations. concern mainli relat compani default payment fccb holder well overdu amount certain creditor lenders. compani post consolid net loss rs . crore quarter end decemb . list senvion se help compani fund need seen whether bring cash indian shores. a.m stock rs . . per cent . touch high rs . low rs . trade today. around . lakh share trade counter two-week averag . lakh share .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>low calendar year -. market life time high stuck rang six year final broken range. market euphoria alway function market pe absolut market level. pe basi still time fy. market level life time high market pe average. probabl could begin good time markets. earn recoveri pick three macro paramet current account deficit fiscal deficit correct good stabl govern elect thing make sure seen ralli recent lows. may begin secular long-term trend .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
