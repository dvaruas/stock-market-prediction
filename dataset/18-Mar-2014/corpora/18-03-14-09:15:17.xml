<items><item><body> The new CPSE fund is a good way for the government to sell stock, but investors should consider all aspects before committing.  Almost two years after it was first mooted , the specialised exchange-traded fund (ETF) for public sector    is finally getting off the ground. The government has selected    to run this fund, which will be called the    (CPSE) ETF.  ETFs are generally based on an equity index and replicate that index in their portfolio so that investors can    in it easily. The CPSE fund's underlying index is a new index of the same name that    Stock Exchange launched last week.  The index has 10 stocks as its components &#8212;   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   , PFC, REC, Container Corp and    .  While ETFs are   , they are bought and sold on stock exchanges like mutual funds. An investor who wants to invest in this basket of public sector stocks can buy this    instead.  For the government, the CPSE ETF essentially offers an on-demand , instant divestment route that is always   . This is the solution to a different problem that was talked about when such a fund was first mooted a couple of years back.  At the time, the idea was that a PSU ETF could be used to bundle less-desirable PSU stocks with more saleable ones, sort of like what your provisions store does to get rid of hard-to-sell items.  That idea was clearly unworkable. By contrast, the new ETF consists entirely of what may be called investible PSUs. From the government's point of view, the ETF sets it free from not being able to tap the equity    with agility, when it's the best time to do so. Currently, it has to go through the rigmarole of a fresh offer-forsale whenever it has to disinvest.  Given the glacial pace at which things move, it has hardly ever managed to do so at the best possible moment. The ETF will be an effective antidote to this problem. The demand for the ETF (and thus the price realised ) will be highest when it's the best time to disinvest. At such times, the government should be able to disinvest smoothly in a graduated, on-demand manner.  That's the story from the government's point of view, whose overriding interest in the matter is to sell enough stock to help with its fiscal deficit. What about investors ? There are pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, these companies are among the better options among PSUs. At this point of time, they are cheap and thus very good value.  On top of that, the government's fiscal conditions    that these companies will continue to pay good dividends. Moreover, the government has sweetened the deal in an innovative way.  For one, during the NFO, there's a 5% discount from a 'reference price' of these stocks. On top of that, there's a loyalty bonus , whereby investors who stay invested for one year from the NFO will get a bonus one unit for every unit held.  On the negative side, it's generally never a good idea for fund investors to buy a sectoral or a thematic fund. The whole point of investing through an equity fund &#8212; even an ETF or an index fund &#8212; is that you should not have to decide whether and how much exposure you should have to a certain type of stock and how long you should maintain that exposure.  That's why it makes sense for fund investors to invest only in diversified funds. Even if you accept the logic of a thematic fund, it has to be an investing theme, like banks or IT or consumer goods or auto or something else that you think will do better than the rest of the market.  The CPSE ETF is none of these. Instead, it's a strange creature &#8212; a thematic fund where the theme happens to be the promoter , unlike a sector fund, where there is a unified investment case for a particular set of stocks.  So, those are the factors you have to balance out. Tactically, at this point of time, this is an attractive package. Strategically , in the long term, these are companies with a terrible promoter, which has never cared for minority shareholders. Make your choice.  </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>mumbai indian market like open posit note global market shrug concern russia. us european union impos sanction small group offici ukrain appli join russia follow weekend referendum. trade may turn rangebound session progress capit good sector focu launch psu-etf fund. agre water propos invest plan gujarat parent suzuki investor ire possibl legal regulatori challeng threaten scuttl project. compani agre take approv minor sharehold also away mark cost maruti would pay everi vehicl per origin decision. corpor debt restructur empow group approv orchid chemic pharmaceut debt restructur proposal. per term debt restructur compani sell transfer penicillin penem includ carbapenem api activ pharmaceut ingredi busi togeth manufactur facil aurangabad maharashtra associ research develop facil sholinganallur chennai. approv invest rs. . crore karanpura thermal power project jharkhand coal block realloc compani last year. board director accord invest approv north karanpura thermal power project implement jharkhand apprais current estim cost rs. . crore. state-own lic cut stake around per cent sell per cent stake.th countri largest insur offload share constitut . per cent open market transact hero motocorp said file bse. state-run upstream oil compani oil natur ga oil india togeth bought per cent govern stake indian oil corp. govern get rs crore fourth revis disinvest target rs crore current fiscal. govern aim rais rs - via sale stake held state-run trust fund axi bank month-end alok tandon joint secretari depart disinvest said friday. govern hold . per cent stake axi bank via trust fund call specifi undertak suuti. much-await exchange-trad fund etf select heavyweight central public sector unit launch goldman sachs. compani ongc gail coal india indianoil oil india pfc rec contain corp part etf .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
