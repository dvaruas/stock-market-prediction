<items><item><body> Mis-selling in    is prevalent and is one of the key reasons that is hurting the sector's growth is a fact accepted by the Finance Minister, P. Chidambaram himself on several occasions. Though the intermediaries are first to be blamed for it&#8212;an    only pushes products that earn high commission&#8212;is the most popular reasoning given. However, there are several other reasons why a customer ends up buying a wrong product. For instance, it is not always 'mis-selling' but sometimes 'mis-buying' as well&#8212;lack of awareness, expectations of quick returns and using insurance as a tax saving tool, to name a few.   There are challenges faced by financial planners as well to convince a client why a    is right for them, to get the correct and complete data from them for proper assessments of their profile and portfolio.   To tackle these procedural challenges, a few years ago, Irda had proposed carrying out a 'customer need analysis' before selling a life insurance product.     Irda's draft guidelines issued in January 2012, proposed a mandate on intermediaries and the insurance companies to fill up a standard need-analysis worksheet of the customer before effecting the sale of a life insurance policy. This was to ensure that the product that is proposed to be sold is suitable for the prospect and meets his or her needs. This also aimed at tackling under-insurance, which is widespread among insurance buyers.   Though the proposal has not been implemented in the proposed format, a few insurers like Birla SunLife,    Pru Life and TATA AIA life have introduced a few need analysis tools.    Your needs are different at different life stages. Therefore, the need-analysis approach starts by understanding the life stage you are at&#8212; unmarried, married, married with children, nearing retirement and post-retirement &#8212;are the common stages in a product matrix. Once you've selected a life stage, your protection needs are analyzed. For instance, a person raising a young child will definitely have bigger insurance needs than say a young and single person who has just started his career and does not have any dependants. Then, these protection needs also decreases once dependents become independent and loans are closed, that is, when you are nearing retirement or retire.  Next comes assessing your goals and purpose of buying insurance. Do you want a plan for your child's future education needs or accumulate a corpus for your sunset years?   The need for savings and investment are related to the achievement of various financial goals and therefore the product you buy should be able to support these requirements. For instance, while you may need to save for a house from an early life stage, the need for annuity or regular income typically arises after retirement. Also, the need for health cover increases with advancing age. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>hong kong china yuan slip dollar tuesday central bank weekend widen currenc trade band set weaker midpoint fixing. trader said expect yuan trend downward short-term chines economi lose steam. spot yuan chang hand . near midday . per cent previou day close .. pboc fix yuan midpoint . . per cent monday .. yuan fallen . per cent far year eras much nearli per cent gain . peopl bank china pboc engin weak via state bank stamp specul money bet one-way yuan appreciation. effort seen success trader say client activ buy dollar market either stop loss long yuan posit bet weak yuan. demand dollar quit strong big chines bank buy dollar today behalf client central bank interven time trader chines bank shanghai said. yuan remain weak come one two month china economi becom sluggish may fall . short term trader predicted. seri weak data survey made economist say beij struggl meet . per cent growth target year. invest bank includ bank america merril lynch mizuho secur lower forecast china gdp growth disappoint january-februari econom data. saturday pboc doubl yuan daili trade rang enabl rise fall per cent around daili mid-point rate import step make redback final fulli convertible. yet yuan like trade full width band near term last band widen offer guidance. near midday tuesday yuan . per cent weaker fixing. analyst believ yuan almost reach equilibrium level there limit room upside. howev dont expect signific fall yuan given china . trillion foreign exchang reserv higher interest rate continu induc capit inflows. pboc embrac market-driven fx regim paradigm shift higher intraday said dariusz kowalczyk senior strategist credit agricole. report date monday said expect yuan fall . short term gain momentum rise gradual long run. central bank doesnt want non-stop yuan appreci certainli dislik trend non-stop even more. expect yuan stage free fall pboc background said dealer major european bank shanghai .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>surg much . per cent tuesday compani said board approv propos promot pharmaceut ab sweden delist compani india. share astrazeneca rs . rs gmt. stock hit -week high rs march sinc compani first announc propos gain . per cent far month .</body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
