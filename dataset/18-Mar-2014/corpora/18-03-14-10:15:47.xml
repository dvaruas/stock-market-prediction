By choosing one    and time to vanish into radar darkness with 238 others on board, the person &#8212; presumed to be a pilot or a passenger with advanced knowledge &#8212; may have acted only after meticulous planning, according to    experts.   Understanding the sequence that led to the unprecedented plane hunt widening across two vast tracts of territory north and south of the Equator is key to grasping the motives of what Malaysian authorities suspect was hijacking or sabotage.   By signing off from Malaysian airspace at 1.19am on March 8 with a casual "all right, good night," rather than the crisp radio drill advocated in pilot training, a person now believed to be the co-pilot gave no hint of anything unusual.   Two minutes later, at 1.21am local time, the transponder &#8212; a device identifying jets to ground controllers &#8212; was turned off in a move that    say could reveal a careful sequence.   "Every action taken by the person who was piloting the aircraft appears to be a deliberate one. It is almost like a pilot's checklist," said one senior captain from an Asian carrier with experience of jets including the Boeing 777.   There is so far no indication whether the co-pilot was at fault or had anything to do with turning off the transponder. Pilots say the usual industry convention is that the pilot not directly responsible for flying the plane talks on the radio.   Police have searched the premises of both the captain and co-pilot and are checking the backgrounds of all passengers.   Whoever turned the transponder to "off", whether or not the move was deliberate, did so at a vulnerable point between two airspace sectors when Malaysian and Vietnamese controllers could easily assume the airplane was each others' responsibility.   "The predictable effect was to delay the raising of the alarm by either party," David Learmount, operations and safety editor at Flight International, wrote in an industry blog.   That mirrors delays in noticing something was wrong when an Air France jet disappeared over the Atlantic in 2009 with 228 people on board, a gap blamed on confusion between controllers.   Yet whereas the Rio-Paris disaster was later traced to pilot error, the suspected kidnapping of MH370's passengers and crew was carried out with either skill or bizarre coincidences.   Whether or not pilots knew it, the jet was just then in a technically obscure sweet spot, according to a top radar expert.   Air traffic controllers use secondary radar which works by talking to the transponder. Some air traffic control systems also blend in some primary radar, which uses a simple echo.   But primary radar signals fade faster than secondary ones, meaning even a residual blip would have vanished for controllers and even military radar may have found it difficult to identify the 777 from other ghostly blips, said radar expert Hans Weber.   "Turning off the transponder indicates this person was highly trained," said Weber, of consultancy TECOP International.   Not in the manual   The overnight flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur is packed year-round with business people, Chinese tourists and students, attracted in part by code-sharing deals, regular travellers say.   The lockdown of MH370 may have begun as early as 40 minutes into the flight at a point when meals are being hurriedly served in time to get trays cleared and lights dimmed for the night.   "It was a red-eye flight. Most people &#8212; the passengers and the crew &#8212; just want to rest," a Malaysia Airlines stewardess said. "Unless there was a reason to panic, if someone had taken control of the aircraft, they would not have noticed anything."   At some point between 1.07am and 1.37am, investigators believe someone switched off another system called ACARS designed to transmit maintenance data back to the ground.   While unusual, this may not necessarily raise alarms at the airline and the passengers would not have known that something was amiss, said some of the six pilots contacted by Reuters, none of whom agreed to be identified because of company rules.   "Occasionally, there are gaps in the communications systems and the guys in ground operations may not think much of it initially. It would be a while before they try to find out what was wrong," said one captain with an Asian carrier.   Cutting the datalink would not have been easy. Instructions are not in the Flight Crew Operating Manual, one pilot said. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>beij begun search miss flight territori state media said tuesday cite beij envoy . northern corridor project satellit militari radar data suggest aircraft might flown pass far western china chines ambassador said china begun search rescu oper area offici news agenc said .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
