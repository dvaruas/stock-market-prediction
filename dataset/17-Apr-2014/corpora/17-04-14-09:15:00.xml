<items><item><body>     We can all identify the four basic flavours &#8212; sweet, salty, bitter and sour. But, there's a fifth, umami, that no words can do justice to. Much like some of the items on Farrokh Khambata's new menu at Umame. The additions to the menu came after travels to South East Asia for tastings, sourcing and experimentation by Khambata. "We have always strived to bring unique, diverse flavours of the Orient, be it Korea, Bali or Cambodia.   This new menu is yet another effort in that direction," he says. We started our meal with the new sushi offerings: Umame Volcano, Sunset Boulevard and Tempura Prawns. All three dishes were beautifully presented. The Umame Volcano stood out because it was rolled to resemble an actual volcano, complete with flowing lava (orange fish roe). The flavours of the spicy tuna, salmon and crunchy cucumber made this the pick of the sushi.   But after such spectacular starters, the main course, as is the case with most Asian restaurants in Mumbai, falls short. The potatoes, served with crisp basil leaves, can be skipped. We recommend you stick to the sushi and dumplings.   But, our meal did end on a sweet note, thanks to the Pecan Creme Brulee with Mandarin Orange Foam. The creamy brulee topped with a thin layer of caramel is love at first bite. Like the fifth flavour, umami, Umame's new menu is rich, full-bodied but difficult to explain. You have to experience it for yourself. </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>lucknow poll lok sabha seat decid fate candid second phase start morn peac note amidst elabor secur arrangements. poll start peac note. . crore elector exercis franchis choos repres candid chief elector offic umesh sinha said. phase poll held moradabad rampur sambhal amroha badaun bareilli pilibhit shahjahanpur nagina aonla kheri. promin candid fray includ santosh gangwar saleem sherwani begum noor bano. seat four held sp three two last . bjp leader maneka gandhi won aonla seat last time contest stronghold pilibhit. nephew chief dharmendra yadav fray retain badaun lok sabha seat. former mp saleem iqbal sherwani contest aonla congress . congress field begum noor bano moradabad seat former cricket elect last time. bano son test luck rampur seat. former minist santosh gangwar contest bjp ticket bareilly. shafeequrehman barq won last lok sabha poll sambhal bsp ticket fight sp ticket time. total poll centr identifi sensit .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>bhopal poll lok sabha seat second-phas elect state began today decid fate candid includ woman. poll began morena bhind gwalior guna sagar tikamgarh damoh khajuraho bhopal rajgarh lok sabha constitu offici sourc said. fate number promin candid includ union minist jyotiraditya guna state unit presid narendra singh tomar gwalior former minist ex-prim minist atal bihari vajpaye nephew anoop mishra morena former ia offic dr bhagirath prasad join bjp day get ticket bhind seal evm day-long polling. besid promin face fray includ former union minist prahlad patel damoh former minist nagendra singh khajuraho rajgarh sit mp narayan singh amlab consid close congress gener secretari singh. poll held till pm measur taken first time elector histori countri enhanc vote percentag special summers. earlier poll use close pm except constitu got earlier also number problems. total voter exercis right franchis constitu poll held booths. conduct poll free fair manner elect deploy . lakh poll staff adequ number central state polic forc special dacoit-infest chambal region. third final phase poll madhya pradesh remain ten seat held april . first-phas poll held nine constitu april .</body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item></items>
