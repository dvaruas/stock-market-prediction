Only a few months ago, analysts were abuzz about the risks posed by rising    deficits and growing dependence on fickle foreign capital flows in the supposedly brittle economies of Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa. Now, the two countries that were seen as the most fragile of the five are home to two of the emerging world's best performing stock    this year: Indonesia and India.  The big change is in politics, as markets look to new leaders to repair the financial fault lines. Overall, stock markets in the emerging world are flat this year, but Indonesia is close to its all-time highs, up 20% in dollar terms on polls that still project victory for Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo in July presidential elections.  In India, the talk is that to determine the fair value of the Sensex just multiply by 100 the number of seats BJP is likely to win under Narendra Modi. Both are seen as energetic replacements for lame-duck incumbents, and analysts are crediting the personalities behind the 'Jokowi Rally' and the 'Modi Rally'. In Brazil, incumbent Dilma Rousseff is still the frontrunner, but the market is rising sharply on any news hinting that she could lose. This is an 'Anyone But Dilma' rally.  It is hard to remember a year when global markets were responding so directly to fresh political personalities. In the two years before the global financial crisis of 2008, voters in 30 of the largest democracies were turning out the ruling party in only one out of three elections; by last year that rate had risen to two out of three, and markets are embracing the newcomers. Earlier personality-driven rallies accompanied the 2010 victory of Benigno Aquino III in the Philippines, and the 2012 triumphs of Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico, and Shinzo Abe in Japan.  This year, politically driven rallies are breaking out with even more force in part because it is a big year for elections, with 40% of the 110 emerging democracies holding national polls. Six major emerging markets hold votes in the next six months, a concentration of big elections not seen since the halcyon days of 2006, when investors were rooting for continuity rather than change.  Now, frustration is bubbling over. Over the last decade, the average age of political regimes in the big emerging markets doubled from four years to more than eight years, and it is no accident that every core member of the fragile five had a regime over eight years old. The growing complacency of these stale regimes set the stage for the financial missteps &#8212; particularly rising current account deficits &#8212; that produced runs on their currencies last year.  Today markets are recovering in countries where prospects of a leadership change are growing. Six months ago, Modi was not yet a clear frontrunner, Dilma was a shoo in, and Jokowi was not yet a declared candidate.  In emerging nations, particularly, opinion polls can often be unreliable, but it is hard to ignore the trend in favour of the challenger in all the three countries. In South Africa and Turkey, which also hold national elections later this year, there is no strong challenger, and the market is largely ignoring the coming elections.  It will be intriguing to see how these political 'hope rallies' unfold after the elections. Looking back 20 years at the market reaction to 140 national elections in the 30 major democracies, it is clear that markets often rise during the campaign of a reform-minded challenger, and they take off if that challenger comes to power in the wake of a financial or political crisis, then delivers on reform.  There were 16 such post-crisis cases, including the rise of D J Kim in South Korea following the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, and of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as the spectre of sovereign default threatened Brazil in 2002. In such circumstances, on average, the local    beat the emerging market average by around 40 percentage points in the first 18 months of the new regime.  Similar personality pops are now driving up markets that were only recently teetering on the brink of crisis. Pakistan was in dire need of an IMF bailout when Nawaz Sharif took office last May, but he has delivered on promises of reform, increasing the meagre tax base and tightening budget discipline. Over the past year, Pakistan is one of the hottest emerging stock markets.  Greece was still ground zero of the Euro crisis when 2012 elections ushered in prime minister Antonis Samaris, but his government has pushed reforms &#8212; including cuts to fat public sector wages and employment &#8212; that have impressed the stock market. It is up 138% since he took office.  But market darlings cannot rest easy. Markets measure the confidence of investors, who tend to project their high hopes for reform onto promising candidates, and are often left disappointed. Market enthusiasm for Abe and Pena Nieto has waned of late as questions arise about the impact of their reforms, but remains high for Aquino because Philippines is growing fast, and a 'Renzi Rally' is endorsing Italy's dynamic new leader, Matteo Renzi.  That is a signal to Modi, Jokowi, and Anyone but Dilma. Even if challengers manage to win, personality won't keep their rallies going unless they meet market hopes for reform.
