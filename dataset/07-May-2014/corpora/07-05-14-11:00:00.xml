And this is what prompted Michael Burns, an online university instructor from Connecticut, USA who's living in Mumbai for three years, to launch Tall Tales last April. Inspired by an American radio programme, Tall Tales is an initiative offering budding and professional writers a platform to present first-person, non-fiction stories live.   "I started it because I'm a huge fan of personal, non-fiction storytelling. Everyone has something unique to say. Sometimes it's just not so obvious what it is. I work closely with the people who submit stories to make them stronger and to give them more depth and texture," says Burns. Tall Tales invites stories from amateur as well as established writers.   Burns says that what he looks for is not so much polished or performanceready stories, but a unique perspective and brutal honesty. "Honesty and the willingness to share the most intimate, private feelings, are among the supreme factors that make a so-so story great," he explains. Shows are held every six weeks at Studio X in Kitab Mahal, Fort, and at various venues in Bandra.   There will be a debut show where stories are heard for the first time and another, the 'encore', or the repeat of those stories. The shows are open to the general public. Dramatic and humorous stories are the ones most narrated. With a stress on excellence, the stories are rehearsed and edited often before each show. Rohit Nair, a 27-year-old IT professional and writer, is among the many contributors who found their calling with the initiative. Nair, who is also the Assistant Director at Tall Tales, was one of the earliest storytellers and is a regular at the shows.   "Given the monotonous life we lead, there is so much to learn from all that is happening around us. I look at bringing out the hidden humour and truth through my stories," says Nair. Come May 17, Tall Tales will showcase six best stories, which Burns admits, have been torturously narrowed down from a bank of over 40, at the NCPA, Mumbai.   These stories, he says, cannot be categorised and one will find elements of drama, humour and a lot more in each. "Come to one of our shows and you'll find that the storyteller is speaking directly to you&#8212; maybe it's about a decision that you had to make one day, or about a heart that you broke once (or maybe it was your own that was broken), or about a risk you took never knowing if it was going to pay off. Our job is to create something you'll be thinking of not just for days, but years later," is Burns promise. </body><sentiment>neutral</sentiment></item><item><body>jose mourinho would make outstand poker player. ive read special one controversi biographi mourinho diego torr torr reveal set guidelin mourinho prepar player coach real madrid. game won team commit fewer errors. footbal favour whoever provok error opposition. away home instead tri superior opposit better encourag mistakes. whoever ball like make mistake. whoever renounc possess reduc possibl make mistake. whoever ball fear. whoever therebi stronger. true footbal poker sports. need outstand thing play brilliantli win simpli need make less mistak opponent. mourinho master art team coached. team typic play deep defend vigor dont obsess possess incis counter-attack. counterpunch ascend season tiki taka possession-ori team like bayern barcelona experienc temporari downsw play also tailor induc mistak opponents. pep guardiola time barcelona coach would spend hour game watch dvd forthcom oppon figur weak exploit -
