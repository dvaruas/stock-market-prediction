In Lake Town, Trinamool    goons targeted three college students for acting as Left Front polling agents, beating them with revolver butts, forcing them into mock executions, and smearing the blood of a    supporter on his mother's face, saying that she would "see his blood again" if he stayed with the Left.  The attack lasted three hours but Lake Town police station, barely 2km way, had no clue. Three of the victims &#8212; Kaushik Roy, Amit Dasgupta and    &#8212; were taken to a government hospital where they were threatened again by the goons.  "The hoodlums have threatened to return tonight. We don't know where to go," said Raju's mother Vandana, who had blood smeared on her face. Though there is a police picket in the area, residents are scared and have started leaving the colony, saying police refused to entertain the complaint.  Trinamool MLA Sujit Bose denied the allegations, saying: "It was not a political clash but a fight between neighbours. There are injuries on both sides, which is why police have lodged a case and counter-case."  The attack comes at the end of a violent election where the ruling party is accused of bloodshed and intimidation and at least two Trinamool MLAs are "absconding" after being accused of leading mob attacks. One of them is Minakha MLA   , who is alleged to have been present during the ambush on CPM cadre in Haroa's Brahmanchak village on the last voting day on Monday. The victims allege that Usharani and her husband, a Trinamool leader, led a band of gunmen who shot at them and hurled bombs to stop them from going to the polling booth. The victims were living in exile since the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and had been brought home for the polls on the orders of the   .  What happened in Patipukur and Haroa is different from the silent terror in Beliaghata and other parts of Kolkata. Trinamool goons singled out CPM supporters and intimidated them. Beliaghata is the    where    sat on a fast when riots hit Kolkata during Partition till the marauders laid down their arms. The violence escalated after the third round of voting in Bengal.  "This has been going on since last one month. If one dared to lodge a complaint, Trinamool goons assaulted him," said a CPM leader in Beliaghata. On the evening before the poll, the threat was direct: "If you dare step out, you will get beaten up and banished from the locality."  The intimidation escalated to such an extent in Kolkata that many CPM men could not come out and vote on May 12. Those who dared defy the diktat bore the brunt. However, police said most of the complaints were false. "Do you file an FIR for tearing a poster," asked an officer.  Only six of 44 poll-repeated complaints in a sensitive area in Kolkata were turned into FIRs. Three of them are by Trinamool two by CPM and the sixth by Congress.  "The elections, even in Kolkata, are more like a test match than a T-20. The threats begin as soon as election dates are declared. If police acted tough in the initial phases, it would help create a terror-free atmosphere," said a    leader.  Opposition workers say there were lapses by police in mapping out vulnerable areas on the basis of which central forces are deployed. Left Front chairman    has questioned why the Left has been slapped with over 200 cases in Kolkata and adjoining districts when over 197 of their supporters have been injured in the "ruling party terror".  Former chief minister    put the blame on election observers. "Observers have done a criminal job. They have left the hapless people of this state unprotected amid violence by the ruling party. Now they are moving around with smiles on their faces," he said.  Trinamool has denied the allegations. Party spokesperson    said CPM's demand for repolling in 3,000 booths was "laughable". "They deliberately hyped up a few sporadic incidents and are making a mountain out of a molehill," he said. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
