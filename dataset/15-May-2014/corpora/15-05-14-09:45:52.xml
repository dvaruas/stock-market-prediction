<items><item><body>MUMBAI:    said it was allowed to launch a generic version of Novartis' leukemia drug    in the    on February 1, 2016, under a settlement agreement between the two companies.   The other terms of the agreement are confidential, Sun Pharma said in a statement on Thursday.   Sun Pharma's subsidiary holds a tentative approval from the    for a generic version of Gleevec. As per    data, Gleevec had annual sales of about $2 billion in the United States, Sun said. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item><item><body>       Cochlear implants can restore hearing for some people, and even allow them to hear for the first time. With the help of specialised hardware, they can tune out what you don't want to hear     Retinal implants can restore the ability to see motion and shapes for people blinded by a certain genetic condition already. Better versions of these implants could give you the night vision of a cat.     Researchers have already developed contacts that can zoom. A retinal prosthetic that could do the same thing should make it possible to do this all the time.     Directly stimulating areas of the brain can already boost people's mathematical abilities in a lab setting.     Researchers claim that once we understand how practising a skill transforms the brain over time, we might be able to use implants to cause those same transformations to occur, providing the motor memory for kung-fu skills, or whatever else you want to learn.     The military's    (DARPA) is already experimenting with brain implants that will help soldiers suffering from traumatic brain injuries by using electrodes to stimulate damaged tissue.     Researchers have already used a neuroprosthetic sensor to control a robotic arm. As this technology is refined, that control will only become more accurate, allowing for remote control of robots, computers, and more.     Once these implants can transmit and receive information, it should be possible to think of a topic &#8212; or look at a tree or painting &#8212; and send that information to the web, and have relevant results fed back into your brain. </body><sentiment>positive</sentiment></item></items>
