At the same time, it has been a widely misunderstood instrument when it comes to framing and executing an investor's asset allocation strategies.   For instance, we know that the straightforward tax treatment&#8212;interest earned is clubbed with your income and taxed at 10% to 30%, depending on the slab you fall in. Therefore, the actual yield on the fixed deposits would also vary from individual to individual. Meaning, you could be earning a higher rate than your colleague but because you fall under a higher tax bracket your actual return from the investment is comparatively less. We all know this and yet rarely do the math before fixing the money.   This is from the perspective of FDs as a standalone investment option. However, from a perspective of financial planning, fixed deposits have a crucial role to play throughout your financial life. Here are some tips on their optimum utilisation.   Building an emergency fund: The basic function of an emergency fund is easy access to money when required. However, most emergencies come unannounced. Thus the money kept aside towards this fund should be available on demand, making fixed deposits with a bank closest to the investor's residence an ideal choice. Although the returns earned on emergency fund should not matter to an investor, the FD would help them earn optimum returns on these funds.   Setting-up the Investment Base for a new investor: In the early stages of one's career, when an individual begins to set-up his/ her investment base, it is essential that the foundation be created with the help of instruments which do not have any volatility with regards to its income appreciation potential.  An investor in their early career stages definitely has high risk-appetite but it is important that this risk-appetite is built on a strong and steady foundation. This foundation will help the early starters to meet any unforeseen lump-sum expenditures without any problems. These foundation investments should be preferred in the debt sector, and fixed deposits is a good choice.   Profit bookings on high-risk investments: All those investors seeking high-growth on their investments and moving investments in equity sector, commodities or even real estate should also imbibe the discipline to book regular profits in good times.  Adequate care should be taken to ensure that these profits are not ploughed back into risky assets, but can be diverted to the debt segment. Bank FDs or even company FDs are ideal options for parking the profits earned on risky investments. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>singapor hit near -month high thursday inflat eas lead gain among emerg asian currenc pare gain central bank seen intervening. rupe rose much . per cent . per dollar strongest sinc juli . wholesal price-bas inflat april slow two-month low . per cent well forecast . per cent poll. south korean won rose fund inflow countri bonds. author spot buy dollar stem won appreci offici bid strong trader said. taiwan dollar edg inflow foreign financi institutions. howev philippin peso fell investor took profit recent gain amid caution possibl intervent central bank .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>mumbai rose . per cent year-on-year two week end may compar . per cent year earlier said thursday. money suppli rs crore . trillion may compar rs crore april central bank data showed. reserv money rose annualis . per cent week may higher . per cent year earlier said. currenc circul grew . per cent year-on-year week may lower . per cent year earlier. currenc circul rs crore week may rs crore .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi encourag declin inflat today express hope trend would continu said govern remain cautiou impact possibl defici monsoon. encourag inflat number come down... whole moment appear track far inflat concerned...it someth smile said comment drop wholesal inflation. wpi april slow . per cent . per cent previou month mainli due eas food fuel prices. mayaram hope go forward current financi year inflat number moder further. howev sound caution possibl defici monsoon due el nino effect. believ need cautiou alert. adequ stock foodgrain meet eventuality. therefor believ slightli sluggish monsoon go realli impact suppli chain manner disrupt secretari said. retail inflat shot -month high april mayaram said elect consum price index cpi gener inch up. lot expenditur happens. obvious lot liquid market. take number someth worri said. rbi schedul announc bi-monthli monetari polici review june kept key repo unchang per cent say retail inflat sticky. industri demand eas repo rate boost econom growth country. queri regard mayaram said would . per cent gdp last fiscal. still stand number fiscal deficit ad .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>new delhi recov . per cent rs per quintal thursday specul creat fresh posit demand spot market pick amid drop output. sugar deliveri may move rs . per cent rs per quintal open interest lots. sweeten deliveri may also trade margin rs . per cent rs per quintal lots. analyst said fresh posit built specul support improv demand bulk consum spot market help sugar price recov futur trade .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
