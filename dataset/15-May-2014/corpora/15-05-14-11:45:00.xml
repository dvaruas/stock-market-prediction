<items><item><body> Management at Instagram believes its user base will eventually grow to 1 billion monthly active users &#8212; making the photo sharing app far, far bigger than Twitter. Currently, Instagram has 200 million monthly active users, putting it within catching distance of Twitter's 255 million MAUs.   Twi t t er CEO Dick Costolo has long believed that Twitter will reach every person on the planet. But user growth at Twitter has mostly stalled and with absent radical changes that goal looks like a pipe dream. Instagram, however, is currently doubling its user base every year. That growth will slow, of course. But it would be a psychologically punishing moment for Costolo's people if Instagram eclipses Twitter.   When asked whether the 200 million user statistic merely represented downloads or current active Instagram users, Jim Squires, Instagram's director, market operations, said the 200 million were MAUs, and that he expected that number to grow dramatically.   "Because Instagram is imagery-oriented, it's universal ... we're very focused on growth and plan to grow it to 1 billion users. That's what we're doing."   Instagram isn't bound by language &#8212; a cool picture from Thailand can go as viral as one from Boise, Idaho; but a Facebook post in English might grind to a halt where people speak Thai. Squires said two-thirds of Instagram's users are outside the US and that the app was seeing "heavy" growth internationally. "I don't see that stopping anytime soon," Squires added. </body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>buy stop loss rs target rs .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>buy stop loss rs target rs .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item><item><body>recent slew report pop show fit app log sell data ad compani citi planner others. natur app lot sensit person data might want world. let take look what go on. youll find hundr differ fit app everi type exercis smartphone. privaci polici detail data. likewis kind app want help get pregnant quit smoke lose weight whatev else. data input get collect somewher lot case sold privat companies. everi app fit health app incred amount sensit data you. wrong hand data could use you. app want data sell companies. recent studi fcc studi differ health fit app found sent data differ third parties. data includ name email address exercis habit diet medic symptom search locat gender more. isnt first studi show quick review health app privaci polici show mani collect data use advertis .</body><sentiment>negative</sentiment></item></items>
